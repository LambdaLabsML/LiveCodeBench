            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding a list of all strings that appear on the screen as Alice types a given target string using a special keyboard with two keys: one appends 'a' to the string, and the other changes the last character of the string to its next character in the English alphabet.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The target string consists only of lowercase English letters.\n- The length of the target string is between 1 and 400.\n- The initial string on the screen is empty.\n- Alice can only press the first key initially.\n\nInput: A string target.\nOutput: A list of all strings that appear on the screen as Alice types the target string.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem requires using the minimum key presses.\n- The sequence of key presses should be considered to generate all intermediate strings.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be solved by simulating the key presses and generating all intermediate strings.\n- The sequence of key presses can be determined by comparing the current screen string with the target string.\n- If the target string starts with the current screen string, the remaining part of the target string can be achieved by pressing key 1 for each character and then key 2 to change the last character if necessary.\n- The problem requires handling two cases: appending 'a' to the current string and changing the last character of the current string to its next character in the alphabet.\n- The alphabet can be represented as a list of characters from 'a' to 'z' to easily get the next character.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- The example with target = \"abc\" helps to understand the sequence of key presses and the generation of intermediate strings.\n- The example with target = \"he\" helps to verify the approach and ensure it works as expected.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n- Initialize the result list with an empty string.\n- Initialize the current string to an empty string.\n- Iterate over each character in the target string.\n- For each character, determine the necessary key presses to get from the current string to the target string.\n- If the current string is a prefix of the target string, append 'a' to the current string and add it to the result list.\n- If the last character of the current string needs to be changed to match the target string, change it to its next character in the alphabet and add it to the result list.\n- Repeat the process until the target string is reached.\n- Return the result list.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def stringSequence(self, target: str) -> List[str]:\n        result = [\"\"]\n        current = \"\"\n        for char in target:\n            if not current or current == result[-1]:\n                current += \"a\"\n                result.append(current)\n            while current and current[-1] != char:\n                last_char = current[-1]\n                alphabet = [chr(i) for i in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)]\n                if last_char in alphabet:\n                    index = alphabet.index(last_char)\n                    next_char = alphabet[(index + 1) % 26]\n                    current = current[:-1] + next_char\n                    result.append(current)\n                else:\n                    #

The game consists of n rounds where Alice and Bob summon one of three magical creatures each round: a Fire Dragon (F), a Water Serpent (W), or an Earth Golem (E). The points are awarded based on the rules: \n- If one player summons a Fire Dragon and the other summons an Earth Golem, the player who summoned the Fire Dragon is awarded a point.\n- If one player summons a Water Serpent and the other summons a Fire Dragon, the player who summoned the Water Serpent is awarded a point.\n- If one player summons an Earth Golem and the other summons a Water Serpent, the player who summoned the Earth Golem is awarded a point.\n- If both players summon the same creature, no player is awarded a point.\n\nThe key constraints and edge cases are:\n- Bob will never summon the same creature in two consecutive rounds.\n- The input string s consists of n characters 'F', 'W', and 'E', representing the sequence of creatures Alice will summon in each round.\n- 1 <= s.length <= 1000\n- s[i] is one of 'F', 'W', or 'E'.\n- The output should be the number of distinct sequences Bob can use to beat Alice, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nThe input is a string s representing Alice's sequence of moves, and the output is the number of distinct sequences Bob can use to beat Alice.\n\nA subtle requirement is that the solution should consider all possible sequences of moves for Bob that satisfy the given constraints and calculate the points for each sequence.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nThe crucial observations that lead to the solution are:\n- The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to store the number of winning sequences for Bob given Alice's sequence and the current state of Bob's sequence.\n- The state of Bob's sequence can be represented by the last move he made and the current round.\n- The points are awarded based on the rules, and Bob beats Alice if his points are strictly greater than Alice's points after n rounds.\n- The solution should consider all possible sequences of moves for Bob that satisfy the given constraints.\n\nThe key algorithmic insights are:\n- Using a recursive approach or dynamic programming to store the number of winning sequences for Bob given Alice's sequence and the current state of Bob's sequence.\n- The solution should iterate over all possible moves for Bob in each round and update the number of winning sequences accordingly.\n\nImportant realizations include:\n- The need to consider the constraint that Bob will never summon the same creature in two consecutive rounds.\n- The need to calculate the points for each sequence and compare them to determine if Bob beats Alice.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights include:\n- Example 1: Input: s = FFF, Output: 3\n- Example 2: Input:

current state of Bob's sequence.\n- Define a recursive function dp(i, last_move, alice_points, bob_points) that calculates the number of winning sequences for Bob given the current state.\n- Iterate over all possible moves for Bob in each round and update the number of winning sequences accordingly.\n- Use the memoization table to store and retrieve the number of winning sequences for each state.\n- Calculate the points for each sequence and compare them to determine if Bob beats Alice.\n- Return the number of distinct sequences Bob can use to beat Alice, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle include:\n- Using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n- Considering the constraint that Bob will never summon the same creature in two consecutive rounds.\n- Handling the base case where the number of rounds is 0.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countWinningSequences(self, s: str) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9

The allowed operations are shifting a character in `s` to the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around to 'a' if the character is 'z') at a cost of `nextCost[j]`, or shifting a character in `s` to the previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around to 'z' if the character is 'a') at a cost of `previousCost[j]`, where `j` is the index of the character in the alphabet.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `1 <= s.length == t.length <= 10^5`\n* `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.\n* `nextCost.length == previousCost.length == 26`\n* `0 <= nextCost[i], previousCost[i] <= 10^9`\n\nInput: Two strings `s` and `t` of the same length, and two integer arrays `nextCost` and `previousCost`.\nOutput: The minimum total cost of operations required to transform `s` into `t`.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The shift distance is calculated in a circular manner, i.e., shifting from 'z' to 'a' or from 'a' to 'z' is allowed.\n* The cost of shifting a character to the next or previous letter is dependent on the index of the character in the alphabet.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* The problem can be solved by iterating over each pair of characters in `s` and `t`, calculating the minimum cost to transform the character in `s` to the character in `t`, and summing up these costs.\n* The minimum cost to transform a character in `s` to a character in `t` can be calculated by considering the circular shift and choosing the minimum cost between shifting to the next letter and shifting to the previous letter.\n* The shift distance between two characters can be calculated using the ASCII values of the characters.\n* The problem can be solved using a greedy approach, i.e., choosing the minimum cost at each step.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* `s = \"abab\", t = \"baba\", nextCost = [100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], previousCost = [1,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`\n* `s = \"leet\", t = \"code\", nextCost = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], previousCost = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Initialize the total cost to 0.\n2. Iterate over each pair of characters in `s` and `t`.\n3. For each pair of characters, calculate the shift distance and direction.\n4. Calculate the minimum cost to transform the character in `s` to the character in `t` by considering the circular shift and choosing the minimum cost between shifting to the next letter and shifting to the previous letter.\n5.

The event involves assigning n performers to one of x stages and then awarding a score to each band (a group of performers on the same stage) from a range [1, y]. The task is to return the total number of possible ways the event can take place, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 <= n, x, y <= 1000\n- The order of performers on a stage does not matter.\n- Two events are considered different if any performer is assigned a different stage or if any band is awarded a different score.\n- Some stages might remain empty.\n\nInput: Three integers n, x, and y.\nOutput: The total number of possible ways the event can take place, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem statement implies that each performer can only be assigned to one stage.\n- The score for each band is independent of the other bands.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be broken down into two parts: assigning performers to stages and awarding scores to bands.\n- The number of ways to assign n performers to x stages can be calculated using the formula x^n, because each performer has x choices of stages.\n- The number of ways to award scores to bands is y^k, where k is the number of non-empty stages.\n- The total number of ways to assign performers to stages and award scores is the product of the number of ways to assign performers to stages and the number of ways to award scores to bands.\n- The problem requires considering all possible distributions of performers into bands (non-empty stages).\n- The number of non-empty stages (bands) can vary from 1 to min(n, x).\n- For each distribution of performers into bands, we need to calculate the number of ways to assign performers to these bands and then award scores to these bands.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Example 1: n = 1, x = 2, y = 3. The output should be 6.\n- Example 2: n = 5, x = 2, y = 1. The output should be 32.\n- Example 3: n = 3, x = 3, y = 4. The output should be 684.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n- Calculate the number of ways to assign n performers to x stages.\n- Calculate the number of ways to award scores to bands.\n- Use the concept of Stirling numbers of the second kind to count the number of ways to partition n performers into k non-empty bands.\n- For each k from 1 to min(n, x), calculate the number of ways to assign n performers into k bands and then award scores to these k bands.\n- The total number of ways is the sum over all possible numbers of non-empty stages (bands).\n- Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to efficiently compute the number of ways.\n- Apply modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid overflow.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfWays(self, n: int, x: int, y: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        def stirling2(n, k):\n            if k > n:\n                return 0\n            if k == 0 or n == 0:\n                return 1 if k == 0 and n == 0 else 0\n            if k == 1 or k == n:\n                return 1\n            memo = {}\n            def stirling2_memo(n, k):\n                if (n, k) in memo:\n                    return memo[(n, k)]\n                if k > n:\n                    return 0\n                if k == 0 or n == 0:\n                    return 1 if k == 0 and n == 0 else 0\n                if k == 1 or k == n:\n                    return 1\n                result = (k * stirling2_memo(n - 1, k) + stirling2_memo(n - 1, k - 1)) % MOD\n                memo[(n, k)] = result\n                return result\n            return stirling2_memo(n, k)\n        \n        total_ways = 0\n        for k in range(1, min(n, x) + 1):\n            # Calculate the number of ways to assign n performers into k bands\n            assign_to_bands = stirling2(n, k) * pow(x, k, MOD) % MOD\n            # Calculate the number of ways to award scores to k bands\n            award_scores = pow(y, k, MOD)\n            # Update total ways\n            total_ways = (total_ways + assign_to_bands * award_scores) % MOD\n        return total_ways\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires calculating a score based on a given string s. The score is calculated by iterating through the string from left to right, finding the closest unmarked index j such that j < i and s[j] is the mirror of s[i], marking both indices i and j, and adding the value i - j to the total score. If no such index j exists for the index i, we move on to the next index without making any changes.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The string s consists only of lowercase English letters.\n* The length of the string s is between 1 and 10^5.\n* The mirror of a letter in the English alphabet is its corresponding letter when the alphabet is reversed.\n* If there are no pairs of characters that are mirrors of each other, the score will be 0.\n* If the string is empty, the score will be 0.\n\nInput: A string s consisting of lowercase English letters.\nOutput: The total score at the end of the process.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem requires keeping track of which indices have been marked.\n* The problem requires finding the closest unmarked index j such that j < i and s[j] is the mirror of s[i].\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The mirror of a character can be calculated using the ASCII values of the characters.\n* The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, and the ASCII value of 'z' is 122.\n* The mirror of a character c can be calculated as chr(219 - ord(c)).\n* We need to keep track of which indices have been marked.\n* We need to find the closest unmarked index j such that j < i and s[j] is the mirror of s[i].\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem uses the property that the mirror of a character can be calculated using the ASCII values of the characters.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* We need to iterate through the string from left to right.\n* For each index i, we need to find the closest unmarked index j such that j < i and s[j] is the mirror of s[i].\n* We need to keep track of which indices have been marked.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* We need to start from the current index i and move backwards to find the closest unmarked index j such that s[j] is the mirror of s[i].\n* We need to make sure that we don't consider indices that have already been marked.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example s = aczzx helps to illustrate the problem and the solution.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the score.\n2. Initialize a list or set to keep track of which indices have been marked.\n3. Iterate through the string from left to right.\n4. For each index i, calculate the mirror of the character at index i.\n5. Start from the current index i and move backwards to find the closest unmarked index j such that s[j] is the mirror of s[i].\n6.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the sum of all possible good subsequences of a given integer array nums. A good subsequence is defined as a subsequence where the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the subsequence is exactly 1.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The input array nums has a length between 1 and 10^5.\n* Each element in nums is an integer between 0 and 10^5.\n* A subsequence of size 1 is considered good by definition.\n* The answer may be very large, so it needs to be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nInput: An integer array nums.\nOutput: The sum of all possible good subsequences of nums modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem statement implies that the input array nums is non-empty.\n* The problem requires considering all possible subsequences, not just contiguous subarrays.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* A good subsequence can be formed by appending an element to a previous good subsequence if the absolute difference between the two elements is 1.\n* The sum of all good subsequences can be calculated using dynamic programming.\n* Two arrays, dp0 and dp1, can be used to store the sum of good subsequences ending at each index with the last element being nums[i] and not including nums[i] respectively.\n* The problem can be solved by iterating through the array nums and updating dp0 and dp1 accordingly.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem uses the property that a good subsequence can be formed by appending an element to a previous good subsequence if the absolute difference between the two elements is 1.\n* The problem uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of all good subsequences.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* The example nums = [1, 2, 1] helps to understand how to calculate the sum of good subsequences.\n* The example nums = [3, 4, 5] helps to understand how to handle consecutive elements with a difference of 1.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Initialize two arrays, dp0 and dp1, to store the sum of good subsequences ending at each index with the last element being nums[i] and not including nums[i] respectively.\n2. Iterate through the array nums and update dp0 and dp1 accordingly.\n3. For each element nums[i], calculate the sum of good subsequences ending at index i by considering the sum of good subsequences ending at the previous index with a difference of 1.\n4. Update dp0 and dp1 using the recurrence relations: dp0[i] = (dp0[i] + dp1[i]) % MOD and dp1[i] = (dp1[i-1] + dp0[i-1] * (nums[i] - nums[i-1] == 1) + dp1[i-1] * (nums[i] - nums[i-1] == -1)) % MOD.\n5. Calculate the total sum of all good subsequences by summing up dp0 and dp1 for all indices.\n6. Return the total sum modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Handle the base case where the input array has a length of 1.\n* Handle the case where the input array has consecutive elements with a difference of 1.\n* Use dynamic programming to avoid recalculating the sum of good subsequences for each index.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfGoodSubsequences(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [[0, 0] for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        total = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            dp[i][0] = nums[i]  # Include nums[i]\n            total = (total + dp[i][0]) % MOD\n            \n            for j in range(i):\n                if abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) == 1:\n                    dp[i][0] = (dp[i][0] + dp[j][0]) % MOD\n                    dp[i][1] = (dp[i][1] + dp[j][1] + dp[j][0]) % MOD\n                    \n        return total\n``` \n\nHowever, the solution above still seems incorrect based on the problem description and examples provided. Let's correct that:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfGoodSubsequences(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [0] * n\n        dp[0] = nums[0]\n        total = nums[0]\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            dp[i] += nums[i]\n            total = (total + dp[i]) % MOD\n            for j in range(i):\n                if abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) == 1:\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % MOD\n                    \n        return total\n```\nThe solution provided still seems a bit off. The correct approach should utilize dynamic programming to track the sum of subsequences properly:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfGoodSubsequences(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [1] * n\n        res = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            res = (res + nums[i] * dp[i]) % MOD\n            for j in range(i):\n                if abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) == 1:\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % MOD\n        return res\n```"

The energy of Bob's sword increases by a factor X every minute, and after breaking a lock, the energy resets to 0 and the factor X increases by a given value K.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The initial energy of the sword is 0.\n- The initial factor X by which the energy of the sword increases is 1.\n- The number of locks, n, is equal to the length of the strength array.\n- 1 <= n <= 8.\n- 1 <= K <= 10.\n- 1 <= strength[i] <= 10^6.\n\nInput: An array of integers representing the strength of each lock (strength) and an integer K.\nOutput: The minimum time required to break all locks.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The energy of the sword must reach at least the strength of the current lock to break it.\n- The energy of the sword resets to 0 after breaking a lock.\n- The factor X increases by K after breaking a lock.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be solved using a recursive or iterative approach with backtracking to explore all possible orders of breaking locks.\n- The energy of the sword increases by the current factor X every minute.\n- The time required to break a lock is the minimum time needed for the sword's energy to reach the lock's strength.\n- The problem has a relatively small number of locks (n <= 8), making a brute force or backtracking approach feasible.\n- The order in which the locks are broken affects the total time required.\n- The factor X increases by K after breaking a lock, affecting the energy gain for subsequent locks.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- strength = [3,4,1], K = 1, output = 4.\n- strength = [2,5,4], K = 2, output = 5.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Define a recursive function that takes the current lock index, current time, current energy, and current factor X as parameters.\n2. If the current lock index is equal to the number of locks, return the current time.\n3. Try to break the current lock:\n   - Calculate the time needed to reach the lock's strength.\n   - If the time needed is non-negative, update the current time, current energy, and current factor X.\n   - Recursively call the function for the next lock.\n4. Explore all permutations of locks to find the minimum time required.\n5. Use a backtracking approach to handle different orders of breaking locks.\n6.

For each index `i` in `nums`, we need to perform specific actions based on the value of `nums[i]`.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`\n* `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`\n* The array is circular, meaning moving past the last element wraps around to the beginning, and moving before the first element wraps back to the end.\n\nInput: An integer array `nums` representing a circular array.\nOutput: A new array `result` of the same size as `nums`.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The array is circular, so we need to handle wrap-around cases when moving to the right or left.\n* We need to handle both positive and negative values of `nums[i]`.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* We can use the modulo operator to handle the circular nature of the array.\n* For `nums[i] > 0`, we move `nums[i]` steps to the right, and the new index is `(i + nums[i]) % length`, where `length` is the length of `nums`.\n* For `nums[i] < 0`, we move `abs(nums[i])` steps to the left, and the new index is `(i - abs(nums[i])) % length`.\n* If `nums[i] == 0`, we simply set `result[i]` to `nums[i]`.\n* We can use the fact that `(i - abs(nums[i])) % length` is equivalent to `(i + length - abs(nums[i])) % length` to simplify the calculation.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The circular nature of the array allows us to use the modulo operator to wrap around.\n* We are using the property that `(a + b) % n = ((a % n) + (b % n)) % n` to simplify the calculation.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* The example `nums = [3, -2, 1, 1]` helps illustrate the circular nature of the array and how to handle positive and negative values.\n* The example `nums = [-1, 4, -1]` helps illustrate how to handle negative values and wrap-around cases.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Initialize an empty array `result` of the same size as `nums`.\n2. Iterate over each index `i` in `nums`.\n3. For each `nums[i]`, check if it is positive, negative, or zero.\n4. If `nums[i] > 0`, calculate the new index as `(i + nums[i]) % length` and set `result[i]` to `nums[new_index]`.\n5. If `nums[i] < 0`, calculate the new index as `(i + length - abs(nums[i])) % length` and set `result[i]` to `nums[new_index]`.\n6. If `nums[i] == 0`, set `result[i]` to `nums[i]`.\n7. Return the `result` array.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* We need to handle the case where `nums[i]` is negative and use the correct formula to calculate the new index.\n* We need to use the modulo operator to handle the circular nature of the array.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def constructTransformedArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        length = len(nums)\n        result = [0] * length\n        for i in range(length):\n            if nums[i] > 0:\n                new_index = (i + nums[i]) % length\n                result[i] = nums[new_index]\n            elif nums[i] < 0:\n                new_index = (i + length - abs(nums[i])) % length\n                result[i] = nums[new_index]\n            else:\n                result[i] = nums[i]\n        return result\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum cost to transform an integer `n` into another integer `m` by performing two types of operations: increasing a digit by 1 or decreasing a digit by 1. The cost of transformation is the sum of all values that `n` takes throughout the operations performed.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `n` and `m` consist of the same number of digits.\n* `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^4.\n* The integer `n` must not be a prime number at any point, including its original value and after each operation.\n* If it is impossible to transform `n` into `m`, return -1.\n\nInput: Two integers `n` and `m`.\nOutput: The minimum cost to transform `n` into `m`.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem requires checking if a number is prime, which involves understanding the definition of a prime number.\n* The problem requires exploring all possible transformations from `n` to `m` while ensuring that `n` is not a prime number at any point.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n* To check if a number is prime, we can iterate from 2 to the square root of the number and check if the number is divisible by any of these values.\n* We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible transformations from `n` to `m`.\n* We need to keep track of all the numbers we have visited to avoid visiting the same number multiple times.\n* We need to check if a number is prime before adding it to the queue.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The property of prime numbers that they have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n* The property of BFS algorithms that they can be used to explore all possible paths in a graph.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* The example where `n` is 10 and `m` is 12, which shows that we need to explore all possible transformations from `n` to `m`.\n* The example where `n` is 4 and `m` is 8, which shows that we need to check if a number is prime before adding it to the queue.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Define a function to check if a number is prime.\n2. Initialize a queue with the initial number `n` and a cost of 0.\n3. Initialize a set to keep track of all the numbers we have visited.\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a number and its cost.\n5. If the dequeued number is equal to `m`, return the cost.\n6. Generate all possible next numbers by increasing or decreasing a digit.\n7. For each next number, check if it is prime and if we have not visited it before.\n8. If the next number is not prime and we have not visited it before, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n9. If the queue is empty and we have not found `m`, return -1.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* We need to handle the case where `n` is equal to `m`.\n* We need to handle the case where `n` is a prime number.\n* We need to handle the case where it is impossible to transform `n` into `m`.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def is_prime(self, num: int) -> bool:\n        if num < 2:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def minOperations(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:\n        if self.is_prime(n):\n            return -1\n\n        queue = deque([(n, n)])\n        visited = set([n])\n\n        while queue:\n            current_num, total_sum = queue.popleft()\n\n            if current_num == m:\n                return total_sum\n\n            # Convert current_num to string to easily modify digits\n            str_current_num = list(str(current_num))\n\n            for i in range(len(str_current_num)):\n                # Increase digit\n                if str_current_num[i] != '9':\n                    new_num = int(''.join(str_current_num[:i] + [str(int(str_current_num[i]) + 1)] + str_current_num[i+1:]))\n                    if new_num not in visited and not self.is_prime(new_num):\n                        queue.append((new_num, total_sum + new_num))\n                        visited.add(new_num)\n\n                # Decrease digit\n                if str_current_num[i] != '0':\n                    new_num = int(''.join(str_current_num[:i] + [str(int(str_current_num[i]) - 1)] + str_current_num[i+1:]))\n                    if new_num not in visited and not self.is_prime(new_num):\n                        queue.append((new_num, total_sum + new_num))\n                        visited.add(new_num)\n\n        return -1\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum possible maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in an array after replacing missing elements denoted by -1 with two chosen positive integers.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The array contains integers, some of which are missing and denoted by -1.\n- The missing elements can be replaced with two chosen positive integers.\n- The goal is to minimize the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.\n- The array length is between 2 and 10^5.\n- The integers in the array are either -1 or in the range [1, 10^9].\n- If all elements are -1, the maximum absolute difference should be 0.\n\nInput: An array of integers with some missing values denoted by -1.\nOutput: The minimum possible maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements after replacements.\n\nSubtle requirements and implicit constraints:\n\n- The two chosen positive integers can be the same.\n- The replacements should be done in a way that minimizes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be solved by iterating over possible values for the two chosen integers and calculating the maximum absolute difference for each pair.\n- A more efficient approach involves finding the minimum and maximum values in the array that are not -1 and using these to limit the range of possible values for the two chosen integers.\n- The optimal pair of integers can be found by considering the minimum and maximum values in the array and the differences between them.\n- The maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements can be minimized by choosing the two integers such that they are as close as possible to each other and to the existing numbers in the array.\n- If there are no non-missing elements, the maximum absolute difference should be 0.\n- The problem can be solved by iterating over a range of possible values for one of the integers and calculating the optimal second integer.\n\nCritical examples and test cases:\n\n- Example 1: nums = [1,2,-1,10,8], output = 4\n- Example 2: nums = [-1,-1,-1], output = 0\n- Example 3: nums = [-1,10,-1,8], output = 1\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Extract non-missing elements from the array.\n2. If there are no non-missing elements, return 0.\n3. Find the minimum and maximum values in the array that are not -1.\n4. Iterate over a range of possible values for one of the integers.\n5. For each value, calculate the optimal second integer.\n6. Calculate the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements for each pair of integers.\n7. Keep track of the minimum maximum absolute difference found.\n8. Return the minimum maximum absolute difference.\n\nImportant optimizations and special cases:\n\n- Handle the case where all elements are -1 separately.\n- Use the minimum and maximum values in the array to limit the range of possible values for the two chosen integers.\n- Iterate over a range of possible values for one of the integers to find the optimal pair.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        non_missing = [num for num in nums if num != -1]\n        if not non_missing:\n            return 0\n        \n        min_val = min(non_missing)\n        max_val = max(non_missing)\n        \n        def get_max_diff(x, y):\n            new_nums = []\n            for num in nums:\n                if num == -1:\n                    new_nums.append(x)\n                else:\n                    new_nums.append(num)\n            max_diff = 0\n            for i in range(len(new_nums) -

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the lexicographically largest string from a box after multiple rounds of splitting a given string `word` into `numFriends` non-empty strings. The goal is to determine the largest string that can be obtained after all rounds are finished.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `1 <= word.length <= 5 * 10^3`\n* `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.\n* `1 <= numFriends <= word.length`\n* In each round, `word` must be split into `numFriends` non-empty strings.\n* No previous round can have the exact same split.\n\nInput: `word` (a string) and `numFriends` (an integer)\nOutput: The lexicographically largest string from the box after all rounds are finished.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem implies that the lexicographically largest string should be obtained by considering all possible unique splits across all rounds.\n* The process involves generating all possible splits, storing unique ones, and then finding the lexicographically largest string among them.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* To find the lexicographically largest string, we need to consider all possible unique splits of `word` into `numFriends` parts across all rounds.\n* We can use a recursive or iterative approach to generate all possible splits of `word` into `numFriends` parts.\n* We need to ensure that no previous round has had the exact same split, which implies the need to store unique splits.\n* The lexicographically largest string can be found by taking the maximum of the unique splits.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem relies on the concept of lexicographical ordering, where a string is considered larger than another if it has a higher alphabetical order.\n* The problem also involves combinatorics, as we need to generate all possible splits of `word` into `numFriends` parts.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* The example with `word = dbca` and `numFriends = 2` helps illustrate the process of generating unique splits and finding the lexicographically largest string.\n* The example with `word = gggg` and `numFriends = 4` shows that the only possible split is `g`, `g`, `g`, and `g`, resulting in the lexicographically largest string being `g`.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Initialize a set to store unique splits.\n2. Define a helper function to generate all possible splits of `word` into `numFriends` parts.\n3. In the helper function, iterate over the possible split points and recursively generate splits for the remaining part of the word.\n4. Store each unique split in the set.\n5. Find the lexicographically largest string among the unique splits.\n\nCritical details:\n\n* We need to ensure that the helper function generates all possible splits correctly and stores unique splits in the set.\n* We need to handle the base case where `numFriends` is 1, in which case the only possible split is the entire `word`.\n\nOptimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* We can optimize the solution by using a set to store unique splits, which allows us to eliminate duplicate splits efficiently.\n* We need to handle the case where `numFriends` is equal to the length of `word`, in which case each character in `word` is a separate split.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def answerString(self, word: str, numFriends: int) -> str:\n        unique_splits = set()\n        \n        def generate_splits(word, num_friends):\n            if num_friends == 1:\n                return [[word]]\n            splits = []\n            for i in range(1, len(word)):\n                first_part = word[:i]\n                for rest_split in generate_splits(word[i:], num_friends - 1):\n                    splits.append([first_part] + rest_split)\n            return splits\n        \n        splits = generate_splits(word, numFriends)\n        unique_splits_list = []\n        for split in splits:\n            sorted_split = tuple(sorted(split))\n            unique_splits_list.append(sorted_split)\n        \n        unique_splits_set = set(unique_splits_list)\n        max_string = ''\n        for unique_split in unique_splits_set:\n            string = max(unique_split)\n            if string > max_string:\n                max_string = string\n        return max_string\n```"

Each bag contains a certain number of coins, and the information about the bags is given in a 2D array coins, where coins[i] = [l_i, r_i, c_i] denotes that every bag from l_i to r_i contains c_i coins.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The segments that coins contain are non-overlapping.\n- 1 <= coins.length <= 10^5\n- 1 <= k <= 10^9\n- 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9\n- 1 <= c_i <= 1000\n\nInput: A 2D array coins and an integer k.\nOutput: The maximum amount of coins that can be obtained by collecting k consecutive bags.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The bags are on a number line, implying that the positions of the bags are integers.\n- The segments of coins are non-overlapping, which means that each bag can be associated with at most one segment.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be solved using a sliding window approach.\n- A prefix sum array can be used to efficiently calculate the total number of coins in a range of bags.\n- The prefix sum array can be created by iterating over the coins array and updating the prefix sum array accordingly.\n- For each bag, we need to find out how many segments it belongs to and add the corresponding number of coins to the prefix sum array.\n- A hash map can be used to store the segments and their corresponding coin values, but it's not necessary.\n- A binary search can be used to find the segments that the current bag belongs to, but it's not necessary.\n- The maximum number of coins can be obtained by sliding a window of size k over the prefix sum array and calculating the sum of coins in each window.\n- The problem can be solved in O(n + k) time, where n is the number of bags.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- coins = [[8,10,1],[1,3,2],[5,6,4]], k = 4\n- coins = [[1,10,3]], k = 2\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum possible number of strings in an NG list that satisfies two conditions: \n1. For each already used product name, there exists at least one string in the list that contains the name as a substring.\n2. None of the strings in the list contain any length-2 substring that is not an already used product name.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The product names consist of two uppercase English letters.\n- The number of used product names (N) is between 1 and 26^2.\n- N is an integer.\n- Each product name is a string of length 2 consisting of uppercase English letters.\n- All product names are distinct.\n\nInput: The number of used product names (N) and the product names themselves (S_1, S_2, ..., S_N).\nOutput: The minimum possible number of strings in the NG list.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- Each used product name may appear in multiple strings in the NG list or multiple times within the same string.\n- The NG list must consist of one or more strings, each consisting of uppercase English letters.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be approached by considering the product names as edges in a graph and finding a minimum number of paths that cover all edges.\n- A greedy approach might work, where we iteratively try to add strings to the NG list that cover the most uncovered product names without introducing new substrings not already used.\n- The problem is related to graph theory, specifically edge cover or a similar concept.\n- We need to ensure that each added string to the NG list does not contain any length-2 substring that is not an already used product name.\n- The goal is to find a set of strings that cover all given product names with the minimum number of strings.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n- The example with product names AB, BC, CA, CD, DE, DF, and XX, which results in an NG list with 3 strings: CABCDE, DF, and XX.\n- The example with product names AC, BC, CD, DE, and DF, which results in an NG list with 2 strings: ACDE and BCDF.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input from stdin, which consists of the number of product names N, followed by N lines, each being a product name.\n2. Store the product names in a set or list for efficient lookups.\n3. Implement a function to check if a given string satisfies the conditions for being in the NG list.\n4. Use a backtracking approach to find the minimum number of strings that satisfy the conditions.\n5. In the backtracking approach, iteratively try to add strings to the NG list that cover the most uncovered product names without introducing new substrings not already used.\n6. Check if a string is valid by ensuring it does not contain any length-2 substring that is not an already used product name.\n7. Use a greedy approach or a more systematic method to construct the NG list.\n8.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the total cost for Takahashi to start at the origin, visit N points in a given order, and then return to the origin. The cost of moving from one point to another is given by the Euclidean distance formula.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5\n- -10^9 \u2264 X_i, Y_i \u2264 10^9\n- All input values are integers.\n- The output should have an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-6}.\n\nInput: The number of points N, followed by N lines of coordinates (X_i, Y_i).\nOutput: The total cost of the journey.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The program should read input from stdin and write output to stdout.\n- The output should be a single number representing the total cost.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The cost of moving from point (a, b) to point (c, d) is given by the Euclidean distance formula: \u221a((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2).\n- To find the total cost, we need to calculate the distance from the origin to the first point, then the distance between each pair of consecutive points, and finally the distance from the last point back to the origin.\n- We can use the math.sqrt function to calculate the square root.\n- We need to handle the input and output as per the given format.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Sample Input 1: N = 2, points = [(1, 2), (-1, 0)]\n- Sample Input 2: N = 7, points = [(-14142, 13562), (-17320, 50807), (-22360, 67977), (24494, 89742), (-26457, 51311), (28284, 27124), (31622, 77660)]\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the number of points N from stdin.\n2. Read N lines of coordinates (X_i, Y_i) from stdin.\n3. Initialize the total cost to 0.\n4. Calculate the distance from the origin to the first point and add it to the total cost.\n5. Calculate the distance between each pair of consecutive points and add it to the total cost.\n6. Calculate the distance from the last point back to the origin and add it to the total cost.\n7.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires determining whether it's possible for zero or more people to switch teams so that all teams have equal strength. If it's possible, the minimum number of people who need to switch teams to achieve this must be found.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- There are N people divided into three teams.\n- Each person has a strength value.\n- The strength of a team is the sum of the strengths of its members.\n- The total strength of all people must be divisible by 3 for equal team strengths to be possible.\n- Each person can only switch to one of the three teams (team 1, team 2, or team 3).\n- The number of people (N) is between 3 and 100 (inclusive).\n- Each person's team (A_i) is one of the three teams (1, 2, or 3).\n- For each team, there exists some person who belongs to that team.\n- Each person's strength (B_i) is at least 1.\n- The total strength of all people is at most 1500.\n\nInput:\n\n- The number of people (N)\n- For each person, their current team (A_i) and strength (B_i)\n\nOutput:\n\n- The minimum number of people who need to switch teams to achieve equal team strengths, or -1 if it's impossible.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem assumes that the input values are integers.\n- The problem requires finding the minimum number of switches, not just any possible solution.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The total strength of all people must be divisible by 3 for equal team strengths to be possible.\n- The target strength for each team is the total strength divided by 3.\n- The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach or a similar method to find the minimum number of switches required.\n- The problem involves exploring different combinations of team switches for individuals and calculating the resulting team strengths.\n- The minimum number of switches can be found by trying different switches and checking if the resulting team strengths are equal.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Sample Input 1: 6 people with strengths 2, 5, 5, 3, 3, 6, and team assignments 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, respectively.\n- Sample Input 2: 4 people with strengths 1, 2, 3, 4, and team assignments 1, 1, 2, 3, respectively.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input values from stdin.\n2. Calculate the total strength of all people and check if it's divisible by 3.\n3. If the total strength is not divisible by 3, output -1.\n4. Calculate the target strength for each team by dividing the total strength by 3.\n5. Initialize the current strengths of the three teams to 0.\n6. Iterate through each person and update their team's strength based on their strength value.\n7. Use a dynamic programming approach or a similar method to find the minimum number of switches required to achieve equal team strengths.\n8. Try different switches and check if the resulting team strengths are equal.\n9. Output the minimum number of switches required to achieve equal team strengths, or -1 if it's impossible.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases:\n\n- Handle the case where the total strength is not divisible by 3.\n- Handle the case where there are no people to switch teams.\n- Optimize the dynamic programming approach to reduce computational complexity.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef min_switches(N, teams, strengths):\n    total_strength = sum(strengths)\n    if total_strength % 3 != 0:\n        return -1\n    target_strength = total_strength // 3\n    \n    current_teams = [0, 0, 0]\n    for i in range(N):\n        current_teams[teams[i] - 1] += strengths[i]\n        \n    def dfs(i, teams, strengths, current_teams, switches):\n        if i == N:\n            if current_teams[0] == target_strength and current_teams[1] == target_strength and current_teams[2] == target_strength:\n                return switches\n            else:\n                return float('inf')\n        # Try not switching the current person\n        not_switch = dfs(i + 1, teams, strengths, current_teams, switches)\n        person_strength = strengths[i]\n        original_team = teams[i] - 1\n        # Try switching to each of the other two teams\n        for j in range(3):\n            if j != original_team:\n                new_current_teams = current_teams[:]\n                new_current_teams[original_team] -= person_strength\n                new_current_teams[j] += person_strength\n                switch = dfs(i + 1, teams, strengths, new_current_teams, switches + 1)\n                not_switch = min(not_switch, switch)\n        return not_switch\n    \n    min_switch = dfs(0, teams, strengths, current_teams, 0)\n    if min_switch == float('inf'):\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return min_switch\n\nN = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\nteams = []\nstrengths = []\nfor _ in range(N):\n    A, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n    teams.append(A)\n    strengths.append(B)\n\nprint(min_switches(N, teams, strengths))\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires moving the K-th 1-block from the beginning in a given string S of length N consisting of 0 and 1 to immediately after the (K-1)-th 1-block and printing the resulting string.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 5 \u00d7 10^5\n- S is a string of length N consisting of 0 and 1.\n- 2 \u2264 K\n- S contains at least K 1-blocks.\n- A 1-block is a substring of S that consists of consecutive 1s, and its start and end are bounded by 0s or the edges of the string.\n\nInput: The length of the string N, the block number K, and the string S.\nOutput: The resulting string after moving the K-th 1-block.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem guarantees that S contains at least K 1-blocks.\n- The K-th 1-block should be moved to immediately after the (K-1)-th 1-block.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- A 1-block can be identified by finding sequences of 1s in the string that are bounded by 0s or the edges of the string.\n- To move the K-th 1-block, we need to find the start and end indices of each 1-block in the string S.\n- We can iterate through the string S to find the start and end indices of 1-blocks.\n- The K-th 1-block can be moved by constructing a new string T, where T_i = S_i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r_{K-1}, then T_i = 1 for r_{K-1} + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r_{K-1} + (r_K - l_K) + 1, then T_i = 0 for r_{K-1} + (r_K - l_K) + 2 \u2264 i \u2264 r_K, and finally T_i = S_i for r_K + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Sample Input 1: N = 15, K = 3, S = 010011100011001\n- Sample Input 2: N = 10, K = 2, S = 1011111111\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the input from stdin: N, K, and S.\n2. Find the start and end indices of each 1-block in the string S.\n3. Identify the K-th 1-block and its start and end indices (l_K, r_K) and the (K-1)-th 1-block's end index r_{K-1}.\n4. Construct the new string T by moving the K-th 1-block to immediately after the (K-1)-th 1-block.\n5. Write the resulting string T to stdout.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- Handle the case where the K-th 1-block is moved to immediately after the (K-1)-th 1-block.\n- Ensure that the resulting string T is constructed correctly based on the moved K-th 1-block.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n        one_blocks = []\n        current_block_start = -1\n        for i in range(N):\n            if S[i] == '1' and current_block_start == -1:\n                current_block_start = i\n            elif S[i] == '0' and current_block_start != -1:\n                one_blocks.append((current_block_start, i - 1))\n                current_block_start = -1\n        if current_block_start != -1:\n            one_blocks.append((current_block_start, N - 1))\n\n        l_K, r_K = one_blocks[K - 1]\n        if K - 2 >= 0:\n            r_K_prev = one_blocks[K - 2][1]\n        else:\n            r_K_prev = -1\n\n        result = \"\"\n        if r_K_prev != -1:\n            result = S[:r_K_prev + 1]\n        else:\n            result = \"\"\n\n        result += '1' * (r_K - l_K + 1)\n\n        if r_K_prev != -1:\n            append_index = r_K_prev + (r_K - l_K) + 1\n        else:\n            append_index = (r_K - l_K) + 1\n\n        if append_index < N:\n            result += S[append_index:N]\n\n        print(result)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the K_i-th character from the beginning of a string S after performing a specific operation 10^{100} times. The operation involves changing uppercase letters in S to lowercase, and lowercase letters to uppercase, then concatenating S and the modified string T in this order to form a new S.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The string S consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters, with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive.\n- The number of queries Q and the query indices K_i are integers.\n- 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 2 * 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 K_i \u2264 10^{18}\n\nInput: The string S, the number of queries Q, and the query indices K_i.\nOutput: The characters at the specified indices after the operations.\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n- The operations are performed 10^{100} times, which is an enormous number, implying that the pattern of the string will repeat many times.\n- The string length doubles after each operation.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n- The string S will be concatenated with its modified version T many times, resulting in a repeated pattern.\n- The length of the string after n operations can be expressed as 2^n * len(S).\n- The character at index K_i can be found by determining which operation iteration and position within that iteration it falls into.\n- The pattern of the string repeats every len(S) * 2^n, but this can be simplified by considering the parity of the operation iteration.\n- The index within the operation iteration can be calculated using the binary representation of the operation iteration.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n- The problem can be solved by finding the equivalent index in the original string S or its modified version T.\n- The equivalent index can be found by taking the query index K_i modulo the length of the string after 10^{100} operations.\n- The parity of the operation iteration determines whether the character is from the original string S or its modified version T.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- The example with S = aB and K_i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 helps illustrate the pattern of the string after multiple operations.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1.

Print the number of cells painted with a given color c.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 1 \u2264 N \u2264 5 \u00d7 10^5\n* 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5 (number of queries)\n* In queries of the first type, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 N\n* In queries of the first and second types, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 N\n* There is at least one query of the second type\n* All input values are integers\n\nInput: N, Q, and Q queries\nOutput: The number of cells painted with a given color c for each query of the second type\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n* The problem requires using a data structure that can efficiently handle union and find operations, such as a Union-Find data structure.\n* The problem requires keeping track of the color of each cell and the number of cells painted with each color.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The problem can be solved using a Union-Find data structure to keep track of connected components of cells with the same color.\n* The Union-Find data structure needs to be updated when a query of the first type is encountered, and the count of cells with each color needs to be updated accordingly.\n* The problem requires keeping track of the color of each cell and the number of cells painted with each color.\n* The Union-Find data structure can be used to efficiently find all reachable cells from a given cell x.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem uses the properties of connected components in a graph, where each cell is a node, and two nodes are connected if they are adjacent and have the same color.\n* The problem uses the Union-Find data structure to efficiently handle union and find operations.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* The algorithm uses a Union-Find data structure to keep track of connected components of cells with the same color.\n* The algorithm updates the Union-Find data structure and the count of cells with each color when a query of the first type is encountered.\n* The algorithm uses the Union-Find data structure to efficiently find all reachable cells from a given cell x.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* The problem requires using a data structure that can efficiently handle union and find operations, such as a Union-Find data structure.\n* The problem requires keeping track of the color of each cell and the number of cells painted with each color.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example given in the problem statement, where N = 5 and Q = 6, helps to illustrate the problem and the solution.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Initialize a Union-Find data structure with N cells, where each cell is initially its own parent.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the color of each cell and the number of cells painted with each color.\n3. For each query of the first type, use the Union-Find data structure to find all reachable cells from the given cell x, and update the color of these cells to the new color c.\n4. Update the count of cells with each color accordingly.\n5. For each query of the second type, print the number of cells painted with the given color c.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Use path compression and union by rank to optimize the Union-Find data structure.\n* Handle the case where a cell is already painted with the new color c.\n* Handle the case where a query of the second type is encountered for a color that has not been used before.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass UnionFind:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.parent = list(range(n))\n        self.rank = [0] * n\n        self.size = [1] * n\n\n    def find(self, x):\n        if self.parent[x] != x:\n            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])\n        return self.parent[x]\n\n    def union(self, x, y):\n        root_x = self.find(x)\n        root_y = self.find(y)\n        if root_x != root_y:\n            if self.rank[root_x] > self.rank[root_y]:\n                self.parent[root_y] = root_x\n                self.size[root_x] += self.size[root_y]\n            else:\n                self.parent[root_x] = root_y\n                self.size[root_y] += self.size[root_x]\n                if self.rank[root_x] == self.rank[root_y]:\n                    self.rank[root_y] += 1\n\ndef main():\n    n, q = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    uf = UnionFind(n)\n    color_count = defaultdict(int)\n    cell_colors = {}\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        color_count[i + 1] = 1\n        cell_colors[i] = i + 1\n\n    for _ in range(q):\n        query = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n        if query[0] == 1:\n            x, c = query[1] - 1, query[2]\n            root = uf.find(x)\n            old_color = cell_colors[x]\n            color_count[old_color] -= uf.size[root]\n            to_update = []\n            stack = [x]\n            visited = set()\n            while stack:\n                current = stack.pop()\n                if current not in visited:\n                    visited.add(current)\n                    to_update.append(current)\n                    if current > 0 and cell_colors[current - 1] == old_color and uf.find(current - 1) == root:\n                        stack.append(current - 1)\n                    if current < n - 1 and cell_colors[current + 1] == old_color and uf.find(current + 1) == root:\n                        stack.append(current + 1)\n            for cell in to_update:\n                cell_colors[cell] = c\n                uf.union(cell, x)\n            color_count[c] += uf.size[uf.find(x)]\n        else:\n            c = query[1]\n            print(color_count[c])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires calculating the sum of absolute differences between elements of two sequences A and B for given indices X_k and Y_k. Specifically, for each k, we need to find the sum of |A_i - B_j| for i from 1 to X_k and j from 1 to Y_k.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5, where N is the length of sequences A and B\n- 0 \u2264 A_i, B_j \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^8, where A_i and B_j are elements of sequences A and B\n- 1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^4, where K is the number of queries\n- 1 \u2264 X_k, Y_k \u2264 N, where X_k and Y_k are query indices\n- All input values are integers\n\nInput:\n\n- The length of sequences A and B (N)\n- Sequences A and B\n- The number of queries (K)\n- Queries (X_k, Y_k) for k from 1 to K\n\nOutput:\n\n- For each query k, the sum of |A_i - B_j| for i from 1 to X_k and j from 1 to Y_k\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem requires efficient calculation to handle large inputs\n- The input and output should be handled in a specific format (from stdin and to stdout)\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The naive approach of iterating over all pairs (i, j) for each k would be too slow for large inputs\n- Prefix sums or a similar technique can be used to precompute some information that allows for efficient calculation of the desired sums for each k\n- The sum of |A_i - B_j| for i from 1 to X_k and j from 1 to Y_k can be calculated using the properties of absolute differences and prefix sums\n- Sorting sequence B and using binary search or a similar method can efficiently find the number of elements in B that are less than or equal to a certain value\n- The problem can be solved by precomputing prefix sums for A and B, and then using these prefix sums to calculate the desired sums for each k\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Sample Input 1: N = 2, A = [2, 4], B = [3, 5], K = 4, X_1 = 1, Y_1 = 1, X_2 = 1, Y_2 = 2, X_3 = 2, Y_3 = 1, X_4 = 2, Y_4 = 2\n- Sample Input 2: N = 5, A = [1163686, 28892, 1263085, 2347878, 520306], B = [1332157, 1202905, 2437161, 1291976, 563395], K = 5, X_1 = 5, Y_1 = 3, X_2 = 1, Y_2 = 5, X_3 = 2, Y_3 = 3, X_4 = 1, Y_4 = 2, X_5 = 5, Y_5 = 5\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input from stdin:\n   - Read the length of sequences A and B (N)\n   - Read sequences A and B\n   - Read the number of queries (K)\n   - Read queries (X_k, Y_k) for k from 1 to K\n\n2. Precompute prefix sums for A:\n   - Calculate the prefix sum of A\n\n3. Precompute prefix sums for B:\n   - Calculate the prefix sum of B\n\n4. For each query k:\n   - Calculate the sum of A_i for i from 1 to X_k\n   - Calculate the sum of B_j for j from 1 to Y_k\n   - Use the precomputed prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of |A_i - B_j| for i from 1 to X_k and j from 1 to Y_k\n\n5.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires determining whether it's possible to transform string S into string T using at most K operations. The allowed operations are inserting a character, deleting a character, or replacing a character.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- K is given as 1.\n- Each of S and T is a string of length between 1 and 500000, inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n- The input is given from Standard Input in the format: K, S, T.\n- The output should be \"Yes\" if S can be made identical to T with at most K operations, and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nInput: K, S, T from stdin.\nOutput: \"Yes\" or \"No\" to stdout.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem is a sub-problem of Problem F (Operate K), with K=1.\n- The solution should handle cases where S and T are already identical.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be solved using the Levenshtein distance or a similar edit distance algorithm, but it needs to be adapted to stop early if the distance exceeds K.\n- The Levenshtein distance measures the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.\n- Given K=1, the approach should check if the edit distance between S and T is less than or equal to 1.\n- The edit distance can be calculated by iterating through S and T and comparing characters.\n- If a difference is found, consider insert, delete, and replace operations.\n- The solution should handle cases where S and T have different lengths.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- S=abc, T=agc (replace 'b' with 'g', distance is 1).\n- S=abc, T=awtf (distance > 1).\n- S=abc, T=ac (delete 'b', distance is 1).\n- S=back, T=black (insert 'l', distance is 1).\n- S=same, T=same (distance is 0).\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n- Read K, S, and T from stdin.\n- Calculate the edit distance between S and T.\n- If the edit distance is less than or equal to K (which is 1), output \"Yes\".\n- Otherwise, output \"No\".\n\nCritical details:\n\n- Use a function to calculate the edit distance between S and T.\n- Initialize a 2D array to store the edit distances between substrings of S and T.\n- Fill in the 2D array using dynamic programming.\n- Handle cases where S and T have different lengths.\n- Optimize the solution to stop early if the distance exceeds K.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef edit_distance(s, t):\n    m, n = len(s), len(t)\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(m + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = i\n    for j in range(n + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = j\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1])\n    return dp[m][n]\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        K = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        T = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        distance = edit_distance(S, T)\n        if distance <= K:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n        else:\n            print(\"No\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

The first line contains two integers N and X, and the second line contains N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.\n\nOutput: If a triple (i, j, k) exists that satisfies the conditions, the output should be the indices i, j, k in the format \"i j k\". If no such triple exists, the output should be -1.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The indices i, j, k are 1-based, meaning they start from 1 instead of 0.\n- The output should be in the exact format specified.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- A brute force approach would be inefficient due to its O(N^3) time complexity.\n- A two-pointer technique can be used to find the triple in O(N^2) time complexity.\n- Sorting the sequence A can help in applying the two-pointer technique.\n- Storing the original indices of the elements is necessary to map them back to their original positions.\n- The two-pointer technique involves fixing one element and using two pointers to find a pair of elements that sum up to the remaining value.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Sample Input 1: N = 5, X = 16, A = [1, 8, 5, 10, 13]\n- Sample Input 2: N = 5, X = 20, A = [1, 8, 5, 10, 13]\n- Sample Input 3: N = 10, X = 100000, A = [73766, 47718, 74148, 49218, 76721, 31902, 21994, 18880, 29598, 98917]\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1.
