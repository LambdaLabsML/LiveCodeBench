The game consists of n rounds where Alice and Bob summon one of three magical creatures each round: a Fire Dragon (F), a Water Serpent (W), or an Earth Golem (E). The points are awarded based on the rules: \n- If one player summons a Fire Dragon and the other summons an Earth Golem, the player who summoned the Fire Dragon is awarded a point.\n- If one player summons a Water Serpent and the other summons a Fire Dragon, the player who summoned the Water Serpent is awarded a point.\n- If one player summons an Earth Golem and the other summons a Water Serpent, the player who summoned the Earth Golem is awarded a point.\n- If both players summon the same creature, no player is awarded a point.\n\nThe key constraints and edge cases are:\n- Bob will never summon the same creature in two consecutive rounds.\n- The length of the sequence s is between 1 and 1000.\n- Each character in s is one of 'F', 'W', or 'E'.\n- The answer may be very large, so it needs to be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nThe input is a string s consisting of n characters 'F', 'W', and 'E', representing the sequence of creatures Alice will summon in each round. The output is the number of distinct sequences Bob can use to beat Alice.\n\nA subtle requirement is that Bob beats Alice if the total number of points awarded to Bob after n rounds is strictly greater than the points awarded to Alice.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nThe crucial observations that lead to the solution are:\n- The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to store the number of sequences for each possible state.\n- The state can be represented by the current round, the last creature Bob summoned, and the current score difference between Alice and Bob.\n- The score difference is used to determine if Bob is winning.\n- The dynamic programming approach needs to consider all possible moves for Bob in each round.\n- The result needs to be taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid overflow.\n\nThe key algorithmic insights are:\n- Using a memoization table to store the number of sequences for each state.\n- Recursively exploring all possible moves for Bob in each round.\n- Updating the score difference based on the rules of the game.\n\nImportant realizations include:\n- The need to consider the last creature Bob summoned to ensure he doesn't summon the same creature in two consecutive rounds.\n- The need to use a score difference to determine if Bob is winning.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights include:\n- The example where s = FFF, and Bob can beat Alice with sequences like WFW, FWF, or WEW.\n- The example where s = FWEFW, and there are 18 distinct sequences for Bob to beat Alice.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nThe steps to solve this problem are:\n- Initialize a memoization table to store the number of sequences for each state.\n- Define a recursive function dp(i, last_creature, score_diff) that returns the number of sequences for Bob to beat Alice given the current round i, the last creature Bob summoned, and the current score difference.\n- In the recursive function, iterate over all possible moves for Bob in the current round.\n- For each move, update the score difference based on the rules of the game.\n- Recursively call the dp function for the next round.\n- Store the result in the memoization table.\n- Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle include:\n- Using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n- Taking the result modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid overflow.\n- Handling the base case where the current round is equal to the length of the sequence s.\n- Handling the case where Bob's score is greater than Alice's score.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countWinningSequences(self, s: str) -> int:\n        memo = {}\n        \n        def dp(i, last_creature, score_diff):\n            if (i, last_creature, score_diff) in memo:\n                return memo[(i, last_creature, score_diff)]\n            if i == len(s):\n                if score_diff > 0:\n                    return 1\n                else:\n                    return 0\n            \n            count = 0\n            for creature in ['F', 'W', 'E']:\n                if creature == last_creature:\n                    continue\n                alice_creature = s[i]\n                new_score_diff = score_diff\n                if alice_creature == 'F' and creature == 'E':\n                    new_score_diff -= 1\n                elif alice_creature == 'E' and creature == 'F':\n                    new_score_diff += 1\n                elif alice_creature == 'F' and creature == 'W':\n                    new_score_diff += 1\n                elif alice_creature == 'W' and creature == 'F':\n                    new_score_diff -= 1\n                elif alice_creature == 'W' and creature == 'E':\n                    new_score_diff -= 1\n                elif alice_creature == 'E' and creature == 'W':\n                    new_score_diff += 1\n                count = (count + dp(i + 1, creature, new_score_diff)) % MOD\n            memo[(i, last_creature, score_diff)] = count\n            return count\n        \n        return dp(0, '', 0)\n```"

The cost of shifting a character to the next letter is given by `nextCost[j]`, where `j` is the index of the character in the alphabet, and the cost of shifting a character to the previous letter is given by `previousCost[j]`.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `s` and `t` are strings of the same length.\n* `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.\n* `nextCost` and `previousCost` are lists of length 26, representing the costs of shifting each character to the next and previous letters, respectively.\n* The length of `s` and `t` is between 1 and 10^5.\n* The costs in `nextCost` and `previousCost` are between 0 and 10^9.\n\nInput:\n\n* `s`: a string\n* `t`: a string\n* `nextCost`: a list of integers\n* `previousCost`: a list of integers\n\nOutput:\n\n* The minimum total cost of operations to transform `s` into `t`.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem assumes that the alphabet is circular, meaning that 'z' wraps around to 'a' and 'a' wraps around to 'z'.\n* The problem requires finding the minimum total cost, implying that the solution should be efficient and optimal.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The problem can be solved by iterating over each character in `s` and `t` and calculating the minimum cost to transform the character in `s` into the character in `t`.\n* The minimum cost to transform a character in `s` into a character in `t` can be calculated by considering the costs of shifting the character in `s` to the next or previous letter.\n* The problem can be simplified by calculating the difference between the characters in `s` and `t` modulo 26.\n* The minimum cost to transform a character in `s` into a character in `t` is the minimum of the cost of shifting the character in `s` to the next letter and the cost of shifting the character in `s` to the previous letter.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The circular nature of the alphabet is used to wrap around from 'z' to 'a' and from 'a' to 'z'.\n* The modulo 26 operation is used to calculate the difference between characters.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* The problem can be solved using a greedy approach, where the minimum cost is calculated for each character in `s` and `t`.\n* The solution involves iterating over each character in `s` and `t` and calculating the minimum cost to transform the character in `s` into the character in `t`.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* The problem requires finding the minimum total cost, implying that the solution should be efficient and optimal.\n* The solution involves considering the costs of shifting each character to the next or previous letter.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example where `s = \"abab\"` and `t = \"baba\"` helps to illustrate the problem and the solution.\n* The example where `s = \"leet\"` and `t = \"code\"` helps to test the solution.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1.

The outlier is defined as a number that is neither one of the original special numbers nor the element representing the sum of those numbers.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `3 <= nums.length <= 10^5`\n* `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`\n* The input is generated such that at least one potential outlier exists in `nums`.\n* Special numbers, the sum element, and the outlier must have distinct indices, but may share the same value.\n\nInput: An integer array `nums`.\nOutput: The largest potential outlier in `nums`.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem assumes that there is at least one potential outlier in the array.\n* The special numbers, the sum element, and the outlier must have distinct indices.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The sum of the special numbers and the outlier must be equal to the total sum of the array or one of the elements in the array.\n* The problem can be solved by iterating over each element in the array, calculating the sum of the remaining elements, and checking if the sum of the remaining elements is equal to one of the remaining elements.\n* The outlier can be found by checking which element is not equal to the current element and not equal to the sum of the remaining elements.\n* The problem can be optimized by sorting the array and checking the largest element first.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The sum of the special numbers and the outlier is used to identify the potential outlier.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* The problem can be solved using a single pass through the array.\n* The array can be sorted to optimize the solution.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* The problem requires checking each element in the array to find the potential outlier.\n* The solution can be optimized by sorting the array.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* `nums = [2, 3, 5, 10]`\n* `nums = [-2, -1, -3, -6, 4]`\n* `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5]`\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Sort the array in ascending order.\n2. Calculate the total sum of the array.\n3. Iterate over each element in the array.\n4. For each element, calculate the sum of the remaining elements.\n5. Check if the sum of the remaining elements is equal to one of the remaining elements.\n6. If it is, check which element is not equal to the current element and not equal to the sum of the remaining elements.\n7.

Currently, it constructs the string and checks for palindrome for each node. This results in a lot of repeated computation. \n\nWe can optimize it by checking if the string is a palindrome in a more efficient way. Instead of constructing the string and then checking, we can compare characters from the start and end of the string and move towards the center.\n\nHere's the optimized solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findAnswer(self, parent: List[int], s: str) -> List[bool]:\n        n = len(parent)\n        # Build adjacency list\n        children = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if parent[i] != -1:\n                children[parent[i]].append(i)\n\n        def dfs(x: int) -> tuple:\n            \"\"\"Perform DFS and return the string and whether it's a palindrome.\"\"\"\n            dfs_str = s[x]\n            is_pal = True\n            for child in sorted(children[x]):\n                child_str, child_pal = dfs(child)\n                if not child_pal or child_str != child_str[::-1]:\n                    is_pal = False\n                dfs_str = child_str + dfs_str\n            return dfs_str, is_pal and dfs_str == dfs_str[::-1]\n\n        answer = [False] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Perform DFS for each node and check if the resulting string is a palindrome\n            _, answer[i] = dfs(i)\n        \n        return answer\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We first build an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given parent array.\n*   We define a recursive dfs function that takes a node x as input and returns the string and a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome.\n*   In the dfs function, we iterate over the children of the current node in sorted order, recursively call dfs on each child, and construct the string by prepending the child's string to the current node's character.\n*   We also keep track of whether the string is a palindrome by checking if the child's string is a palindrome and if the constructed string is equal to its reverse.\n*   Finally, we iterate over all nodes, call dfs on each node, and store the result in the answer array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because in the worst case, we might need to construct the string and check for palindrome for each node.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we need to store the adjacency list, the answer array, and the recursive call stack."

The conversions are based on given currency pairs and their corresponding rates for each day.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The initialCurrency is a string of length 1-3 consisting of uppercase English letters.\n* The currency pairs are lists of two strings, each of length 1-3, consisting of uppercase English letters.\n* The rates are real numbers between 1.0 and 10.0.\n* There are no contradictions or cycles in the conversion graphs for either day.\n* The output is at most 5 * 10^10.\n* The input is generated such that the output is a valid floating-point number.\n\nInput:\n\n* initialCurrency: a string representing the initial currency\n* pairs1: a list of lists of strings representing the currency pairs for day 1\n* rates1: a list of floats representing the conversion rates for day 1\n* pairs2: a list of lists of strings representing the currency pairs for day 2\n* rates2: a list of floats representing the conversion rates for day 2\n\nOutput:\n\n* The maximum amount of initialCurrency that can be obtained after performing any number of conversions on both days.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The conversion rates are valid and there will be no contradictions in the rates for either day.\n* The rates for the days are independent of each other.\n* The problem allows for zero conversions on either day.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* The problem can be solved by building a graph for each day and then finding the maximum amount of initialCurrency that can be obtained.\n* The graph for each day can be represented as a dictionary where the keys are the currencies and the values are the maximum amount of that currency that can be obtained.\n* The maximum amount of initialCurrency can be obtained by iterating over all possible conversions on both days and keeping track of the maximum amount.\n* The problem can be solved using a bellman-ford like algorithm or by using a priority queue to keep track of the currencies to visit.\n* The conversion rates for each day are independent, so the maximum amount of initialCurrency can be obtained by first finding the maximum amount that can be obtained on day 1 and then using that amount as the starting point for day 2.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example given in the problem statement: initialCurrency = EUR, pairs1 = [[EUR,USD],[USD,JPY]], rates1 = [2.0,3.0], pairs2 = [[JPY,USD],[USD,CHF],[CHF,EUR]], rates2 = [4.0,5.0,6.0]\n* The case where there are no conversions on either day.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Build a graph for each day by creating a dictionary where the keys are the currencies and the values are the maximum amount of that currency that can be obtained.\n2. For each day, iterate over the currency pairs and update the graph with the maximum amount of each currency that can be obtained.\n3. For day 1, start with 1.0 of the initialCurrency and iterate over the currency pairs to find the maximum amount of each currency that can be obtained.\n4. For day 2, use the maximum amount of each currency obtained on day 1 as the starting point and iterate over the currency pairs to find the maximum amount of each currency that can be obtained.\n5. Keep track of the maximum amount of initialCurrency that can be obtained after performing any number of conversions on both days.\n6. Return the maximum amount of initialCurrency.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Handle the case where there are no conversions on either day.\n* Handle the case where the initialCurrency is not in the graph.\n* Handle the case where a currency is not in the graph for a given day.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxAmount(self, initialCurrency: str, pairs1: List[List[str]], rates1: List[float], pairs2: List[List[str]], rates2: List[float]) -> float:\n        def build_graph(pairs, rates):\n            graph = defaultdict(dict)\n            for (start, target), rate in zip(pairs, rates):\n                graph[start][target] = rate\n            return graph\n\n        def dfs(graph, start, target, amount):\n            if start == target:\n                return amount\n            max_amount = 0\n            for neighbor, rate in graph[start].items():\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    visited.add(neighbor)\n                    max_amount = max(max_amount, dfs(graph, neighbor, target, amount * rate))\n                    visited.remove(neighbor)\n            return max_amount\n\n        graph1 = build_graph(pairs1, rates1)\n        graph2 = build_graph(pairs2, rates2)\n\n        currencies = set()\n        for pair in pairs1:\n            currencies.add(pair[0])\n            currencies.add(pair[1])\n        for pair in pairs2:\n            currencies.add(pair[0])\n            currencies.add(pair[1])\n        currencies.add(initialCurrency)\n\n        max_amount_day1 = {currency: 0 for currency in currencies}\n        max_amount_day1[initialCurrency] = 1.0\n\n        for _ in range(len(currencies)):\n            for start, targets in graph1.items():\n                for target, rate in targets.items():\n                    max_amount_day1[target] = max(max_amount_day1[target], max_amount_day1[start] * rate)\n\n        max_amount_day2 = {currency: 0 for currency in currencies}\n        for currency in currencies:\n            max_amount_day2[currency] = max_amount_day1[currency]\n\n        for _ in range(len(currencies)):\n            for start, targets in graph2.items():\n                for target, rate in targets.items():\n                    max_amount_day2[target] = max(max_amount_day2[target], max_amount_day2[start] * rate)\n\n        # Convert back to initial currency on day 2 if possible\n        for start, rate in graph2.items():\n            if initialCurrency in rate:\n                max_amount_day2[initialCurrency] = max(max_amount_day2[initialCurrency], max_amount_day2[start] * rate[initialCurrency])\n\n        return max_amount_day2[initialCurrency]\n```"

The game starts with Alice removing exactly 10 stones, and for each subsequent turn, each player removes exactly 1 fewer stone than the previous opponent. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The input n is a positive integer representing the total number of stones.\n- 1 <= n <= 50\n- Alice starts by removing exactly 10 stones on her first turn.\n- If n is less than 10, Alice cannot make a move and thus loses.\n\nInput: A positive integer n representing the total number of stones.\nOutput: A boolean value indicating whether Alice can win the game.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when the number of stones left is less than the number of stones the player is supposed to remove.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The game's outcome depends on the number of stones left after each move and the number of stones the next player is supposed to remove.\n- Alice's first move removes 10 stones, leaving n - 10 stones for Bob.\n- For each player's turn, the number of stones they remove is determined by the previous player's move, decreasing by 1 each time.\n- A player loses if the number of stones left is less than the number of stones they are supposed to remove.\n- The game can be simulated by tracking the number of stones left and the number of stones each player is supposed to remove.\n- The key to solving this problem is to realize that the game's outcome can be determined by simulating the game and checking if Alice can make a move that leads to Bob being unable to make a move.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- n = 12: Alice removes 10 stones on her first turn, leaving 2 stones for Bob. Bob cannot remove 9 stones, so Alice wins.\n- n = 1: Alice cannot remove 10 stones, so Alice loses.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n- Check if n is less than 10, in which case Alice loses.\n- Simulate the game by tracking the number of stones left and the number of stones each player is supposed to remove.\n- Start with Alice's move, removing 10 stones and leaving n - 10 stones for Bob.\n- For each subsequent turn, calculate the number of stones the current player is supposed to remove and check if the number of stones left is less than that.\n- If a player cannot make a move, the other player wins.\n- Use a loop to simulate the game, alternating between Alice and Bob, and checking the number of stones left and the number of stones each player is supposed to remove.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def canAliceWin(self, n: int) -> bool:\n        if n < 10:\n            return False\n        \n        stones_left = n\n        alice_remove = 10\n        bob_remove = 0\n        \n        while stones_left >= 0:\n            if stones_left < alice_remove and alice_remove != 10:\n                return False\n            elif stones_left < alice_remove and alice_remove == 10:\n                return False\n            \n            if alice_remove == 10:\n                stones_left -= alice_remove\n                bob_remove = alice_remove - 1\n                alice_remove = 0\n            else:\n                temp = alice_remove\n                alice_remove = bob_remove\n                bob_remove = temp - 1\n                stones_left -= alice_remove\n                \n            if stones_left < 0:\n                return True\n            if bob_remove > stones_left:\n                return True\n        return False\n\n# However, the above approach can be optimized.\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canAliceWin(self, n: int) -> bool:\n        if n < 10:\n            return False\n        return (n - 10) % 21 != 0\n```"

A number `x` is `k-reducible` if it can be reduced to 1 by performing at most `k` operations, where each operation replaces `x` with the count of set bits in its binary representation.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `1 <= s.length <= 800`, where `s` is the binary representation of `n`\n* `s` has no leading zeros\n* `s` consists only of the characters '0' and '1'\n* `1 <= k <= 5`\n* The answer should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`\n\nInput: A binary string `s` and an integer `k`\nOutput: The number of positive integers less than `n` that are `k-reducible`, modulo `10^9 + 7`\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n* The problem requires using a dynamic programming approach or a similar method to efficiently count the `k-reducible` numbers\n* The reduction operation involves calculating the number of set bits in the binary representation of a number\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* To determine if a number is `k-reducible`, we need to simulate the reduction process and check if it can be reduced to 1 within `k` steps\n* The reduction operation can be repeated at most `k` times\n* We can use a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the `k-reducible` numbers\n* The number of set bits in the binary representation of a number can be calculated using the `bin(x).count('1')` expression\n* We need to iterate over all positive integers less than `n` and check if each one is `k-reducible`\n\nCritical examples:\n\n* For `s = 111` and `k = 1`, the `1-reducible` integers less than 7 are 1, 2, and 4\n* For `s = 1000` and `k = 2`, the `2-reducible` integers less than 8 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1.

In the `is_k_reducible(x, k)` function, use a recursive approach with memoization to simulate the reduction process and check if `x` can be reduced to 1 within `k` steps\n4. Iterate over all positive integers less than `n` and check if each one is `k-reducible` using the `is_k_reducible(x, k)` function\n5.

Initialize an array dp where dp[i] represents the sum of elements in all good subsequences ending with the i-th element.\n2. Iterate over the input array nums.\n3. For each element nums[i], calculate the sum of good subsequences ending with nums[i] by considering two cases:\n   * If nums[i] is not included in the subsequence, the sum is 0.\n   * If nums[i] is included in the subsequence, the sum is nums[i] times the number of good subsequences ending with the previous element (nums[i] - 1) or the next element (nums[i] + 1).\n4. Update dp[i] with the calculated sum.\n5. Calculate the total sum of all good subsequences by summing up the dp values for all elements.\n6. Return the total sum modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Use dynamic programming to avoid recalculating the sum of good subsequences for each element.\n* Use modulo operation to avoid overflow.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfGoodSubsequences(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        max_val = max(nums)\n        dp = [0] * (max_val + 1)\n        res = 0\n\n        for num in nums:\n            dp[num] = (dp[num] + num) % MOD\n            if num - 1 >= 0:\n                dp[num] = (dp[num] + dp[num - 1]) % MOD\n            if num + 1 <= max_val:\n                dp[num] = (dp[num] + dp[num + 1]) % MOD\n            res = (res + num) % MOD\n\n        return res\n```"

For each index `i` in `nums`, we need to perform specific actions based on the value of `nums[i]`.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`\n* `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`\n* The array is circular, meaning moving past the last element wraps around to the beginning, and moving before the first element wraps back to the end.\n\nInput: An integer array `nums` representing a circular array.\nOutput: A new array `result` of the same size as `nums`.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The array is circular, so we need to handle wrap-around cases when moving to the right or left.\n* We need to handle both positive and negative values of `nums[i]`.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* We can use the modulo operator to handle the circular nature of the array.\n* For `nums[i] > 0`, we move `nums[i]` steps to the right, and the new index is `(i + nums[i]) % length`, where `length` is the length of `nums`.\n* For `nums[i] < 0`, we move `abs(nums[i])` steps to the left, and the new index is `(i - abs(nums[i])) % length`.\n* If `nums[i] == 0`, we simply set `result[i]` to `nums[i]`.\n* We can use the fact that `(i - abs(nums[i])) % length` is equivalent to `(i + length - abs(nums[i])) % length` to simplify the calculation.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The circular nature of the array allows us to use the modulo operator to wrap around.\n* We are using the property that `(a + b) % n = ((a % n) + (b % n)) % n` to simplify the calculation.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* The example `nums = [3, -2, 1, 1]` helps illustrate the circular nature of the array and how to handle positive and negative values.\n* The example `nums = [-1, 4, -1]` helps illustrate how to handle negative values and wrap-around cases.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Initialize an empty array `result` of the same size as `nums`.\n2. Iterate over each index `i` in `nums`.\n3. For each `nums[i]`, check if it is positive, negative, or zero.\n4. If `nums[i] > 0`, calculate the new index as `(i + nums[i]) % length` and set `result[i]` to `nums[new_index]`.\n5. If `nums[i] < 0`, calculate the new index as `(i + length - abs(nums[i])) % length` and set `result[i]` to `nums[new_index]`.\n6. If `nums[i] == 0`, set `result[i]` to `nums[i]`.\n7. Return the `result` array.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* We need to handle the case where `nums[i]` is negative and use the correct formula to calculate the new index.\n* We need to use the modulo operator to handle wrap-around cases.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def constructTransformedArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        length = len(nums)\n        result = [0] * length\n        for i in range(length):\n            if nums[i] > 0:\n                new_index = (i + nums[i]) % length\n                result[i] = nums[new_index]\n            elif nums[i] < 0:\n                new_index = (i + length - abs(nums[i])) % length\n                result[i] = nums[new_index]\n            else:\n                result[i] = nums[i]\n        return result\n```"

Filter out -1 values from the array and store the minimum and maximum values.\n2. If there are no -1 values, calculate the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.\n3. If there are -1 values, consider the minimum and maximum values in the array that are not -1 to determine the optimal range for replacing -1.\n4. Calculate the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements for different possible pairs (x, y).\n5. Consider the case where x = y and x is one of the existing numbers or a value that minimizes the maximum difference.\n6. Iterate through the array to find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements for the optimal pair (x, y).\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- Handle the case where there are no -1 values in the array.\n- Handle the case where there is only one non -1 value in the array.\n- Optimize the solution by considering the minimum and maximum values in the array that are not -1.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        non_missing = [num for num in nums if num != -1]\n        if not non_missing:\n            return 0\n        \n        non_missing.sort()\n        \n        if -1 not in nums:\n            max_diff = 0\n            for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n                max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(nums[i] - nums[i-1]))\n            return max_diff\n        \n        if len(non_missing) == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        options = []\n        if nums[0] == -1:\n            options.append(non_missing[0])\n        if nums[-1] == -1:\n            options.append(non_missing[-1])\n        \n        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n            if nums[i] != -1 and nums[i + 1] != -1:\n                options.append((nums[i + 1] - nums[i]) // 2)\n        \n        if not options:\n            options.append(0)\n        \n        min_diff = float('inf')\n        for x in non_missing:\n            for y in non_missing:\n                diff = 0\n                temp_nums = nums.copy()\n                for i in range(len(temp_nums)):\n                    if temp_nums[i] == -1:\n                        temp_nums[i] = x\n                diff_x = 0\n                for i in range(1, len(temp_nums)):\n                    diff_x = max(diff_x, abs(temp_nums[i] - temp_nums[i-1]))\n                temp_nums = nums.copy()\n                for i in range(len(temp_nums)):\n                    if temp_nums[i] == -1:\n                        temp_nums[i] = y\n                diff_y = 0\n                for i in range(1, len(temp_nums)):\n                    diff_y = max(diff_y, abs(temp_nums[i] - temp_nums[i-1]))\n                min_diff = min(min_diff, diff_x, diff_y)\n        return min_diff\n\n# However, the above approach is not optimal.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires determining if a given string `s` contains a substring that matches a pattern `p`, where `p` contains exactly one '*' character. The '*' in `p` can be replaced with any sequence of zero or more characters.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- `1 <= s.length <= 50`\n- `1 <= p.length <= 50`\n- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.\n- `p` contains only lowercase English letters and exactly one '*'.\n- A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.\n\nInput: A string `s` and a pattern string `p`.\nOutput: `True` if `p` can be made a substring of `s`, `False` otherwise.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The '*' in `p` can match any sequence of zero or more characters in `s`, including an empty sequence.\n- The match must be a contiguous substring of `s`.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The '*' in `p` can be replaced with any sequence of zero or more characters, which means we need to consider all possible substrings of `s` that could match `p`.\n- Since `p` contains exactly one '*', we can split `p` into two parts: `p_before` and `p_after`, where `p_before` is the part before '*' and `p_after` is the part after '*'.\n- For `p` to be a substring of `s`, `p_before` must match the start of a substring of `s`, and `p_after` must match the end of that substring.\n- The '*' can match any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence), so we need to check all possible substrings of `s` that start with `p_before` and end with `p_after`.\n- We can iterate over `s` to find a substring that starts with `p_before` and then check if the remaining part of `s` (after removing `p_before`) ends with `p_after`.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- `s = leetcode, p = ee*e` should return `True`.\n- `s = car, p = c*v` should return `False`.\n- `s = luck, p = u*` should return `True`.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Find the '*' in `p` and split `p` into `p_before` and `p_after`.\n2. Iterate over all substrings of `s` to find a match for `p`.\n3. For each substring, check if it starts with `p_before`.\n4. If it does, check if the remaining part of the substring ends with `p_after`.\n5. If a match is found, return `True`.\n6. If no match is found after checking all substrings, return `False`.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases:\n\n- We can optimize the solution by only considering substrings of `s` that are at least as long as `p_before` and `p_after`.\n- We need to handle the case where `p_before` or `p_after` is an empty string.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def hasMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:\n        star_index = p.find('*')\n        p_before = p[:star_index]\n        p_after = p[star_index + 1:]\n        \n        for start in range(len(s)):\n            if s[start:start + len(p_before)] == p_before:\n                remaining_s = s[start + len(p_before):]\n                if p_after == '' or remaining_s.endswith(p_after):\n                    return True\n        return False\n```"

Define a function `can_break` that checks if it's possible to cover the string using a given window size and at most `numOps` operations.\n2. Initialize the low and high values of the window size to 1 and the length of the string `s`, respectively.\n3. Perform a binary search over the possible values of the window size.\n4. For each window size, call the `can_break` function to check if it's possible to cover the string using at most `numOps` operations.\n5. If it's possible to cover the string, update the high value of the window size to the current window size.\n6. If it's not possible to cover the string, update the low value of the window size to the current window size plus 1.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the low and high values of the window size converge.\n8. Return the minimum length of the longest substring with identical characters.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* The `can_break` function can be optimized by counting the number of segments of identical characters.\n* The binary search approach can be used to reduce the number of iterations.\n* The problem requires handling the edge cases where the string `s` is empty or the number of operations `numOps` is 0.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minLength(self, s: str, numOps: int) -> int:\n        def can_break(window_size):\n            ops = 0\n            i = 0\n            while i < len(s):\n                # find a segment of window_size identical characters\n                j = i + window_size\n                if j > len(s):\n                    break\n                segment = s[i:j]\n                if len(set(segment)) == 1:  # all characters are the same\n                    ops += 1\n                    i = j\n                else:\n                    i += 1\n            return ops <= numOps\n\n        low, high = 1, len(s)\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if can_break(mid):\n                high = mid\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        return low\n```"

A sequence of numbers `seq` of size 5 contains a unique middle mode if the middle element (`seq[2]`) is a unique mode.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 5 <= `nums.length` <= 1000\n* -10^9 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9\n* The answer may be very large, so it needs to be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nInput: An integer array `nums`.\nOutput: The number of subsequences of size 5 with a unique middle mode modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The middle element of a subsequence of size 5 is at index 2.\n* A unique mode means that there is only one element that appears the maximum number of times in the sequence.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* To find the number of subsequences with a unique middle mode, we need to consider each element in `nums` as the potential middle element of a subsequence.\n* For each element, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 elements from the elements before it and 2 elements from the elements after it.\n* The middle element must be a unique mode in the subsequence, meaning it must appear more frequently than any other element in the subsequence.\n* We can use combinatorics to calculate the number of subsequences.\n* We need to count the occurrences of each number in `nums` to determine potential unique modes.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* Combinatorial calculations to choose elements before and after the middle element.\n* Frequency counting to determine unique modes.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* `nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1]`: The only subsequence of size 5 is `[1,1,1,1,1]`, which can be formed in 6 different ways.\n* `nums = [1,2,2,3,3,4]`: We need to find subsequences where the middle element is a unique mode.\n* `nums = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]`: There is no subsequence of length 5 with a unique middle mode.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Count the occurrences of each number in `nums`.\n2. Iterate over each element in `nums` as the potential middle element.\n3. For each middle element, calculate the number of ways to choose 2 elements from the elements before it and 2 elements from the elements after it.\n4. Check if the middle element is a unique mode in the subsequence by comparing its frequency with other elements.\n5. Use combinatorics to calculate the number of subsequences.\n6. Return the total number of subsequences with a unique middle mode modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Use a modulo operation to avoid large numbers.\n* Handle the case where the middle element is not a unique mode.\n* Optimize the combinatorial calculations using factorials and combinations.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport math\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def subsequencesWithMiddleMode(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        count = {}\n        for num in nums:\n            if num in count:\n                count[num] += 1\n            else:\n                count[num] = 1\n        \n        total = 0\n        for mid_num in count:\n            mid_count = count[mid_num]\n            for left_num in count:\n                left_count = count[left_num]\n                for right_num in count:\n                    right_count = count[right_num]\n                    if (left_num, mid_num, right_num) == (left_num, mid_num, right_num) and mid_count > left_count and mid_count > right_count:\n                        if mid_count == 1:\n                            continue\n                        left_combinations = math.comb(left_count, 2) if left_count >= 2 else 0\n                        right_combinations = math.comb(right_count, 2) if right_count >= 2 else 0\n                        middle_combinations = math.comb(mid_count, 1)\n                        other_count = n - left_count - mid_count - right_count\n                        other_combinations = math.comb(other_count, 1) if other_count >= 1 else 0\n                        total_combinations = left_combinations * right_combinations * middle_combinations * other_combinations\n                        total = (total + total_combinations) % MOD\n                    elif (left_num, mid_num, right_num) != (left_num, mid_num, right_num) and mid_count > left_count and mid_count > right_count:\n                        if left_count == 0 or right_count == 0:\n                            left_combinations = math.comb(left_count, 2) if left_count >= 2 else 1 if left_count == 1 else 0\n                            right_combinations = math.comb(right_count, 2) if right_count >= 2 else 1 if right_count == 1 else 0\n                        else:\n                            left_combinations = math.comb(left_count, 2) if left_count >= 2 else 0\n                            right_combinations = math.comb(right_count, 2) if right_count >= 2 else 0\n                        left_index = nums.index(left_num) if left_num in nums else -1\n                        right_index = nums.index(right_num) if right_num in nums else -1\n                        mid_index = nums.index(mid_num)\n                        if left_index != -1 and right_index != -1 and mid_index != -1 and left_index < mid_index and right_index > mid_index:\n                            middle_combinations = math.comb(mid_count - 1, 0)\n                        else:\n                            middle_combinations = math.comb(mid_count, 1)\n                        total_combinations = left_combinations * right_combinations * middle_combinations\n                        total = (total + total_combinations) % MOD\n        return total\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum possible number of strings in an NG list that satisfies two conditions: \n1. For each already used product name, there exists at least one string in the list that contains the name as a substring.\n2. None of the strings in the list contain any length-2 substring that is not an already used product name.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The product names consist of two uppercase English letters.\n- The number of used product names (N) is between 1 and 26^2.\n- N is an integer.\n- Each product name is a string of length 2 consisting of uppercase English letters.\n- All product names are distinct.\n\nInput: The number of used product names (N) and the product names themselves (S_1, S_2, ..., S_N).\nOutput: The minimum possible number of strings in the NG list.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- Each used product name may appear in multiple strings in the NG list or multiple times within the same string.\n- The NG list must consist of one or more strings, each consisting of uppercase English letters.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be approached by considering the product names as edges in a graph and finding a minimum number of paths that cover all edges.\n- A greedy approach might work, where we iteratively try to add strings to the NG list that cover the most uncovered product names without introducing new substrings not already used.\n- The problem is related to graph theory, specifically edge cover or a similar concept.\n- We need to ensure that each added string to the NG list does not contain any length-2 substring that is not an already used product name.\n- The goal is to find a set of strings that cover all given product names with the minimum number of strings.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n- The example with product names AB, BC, CA, CD, DE, DF, and XX, which results in an NG list with 3 strings: CABCDE, DF, and XX.\n- The example with product names AC, BC, CD, DE, and DF, which results in an NG list with 2 strings: ACDE and BCDF.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input from stdin, which consists of the number of product names N, followed by N product names, each being a string of two uppercase letters.\n2. Create a set or list of the used product names for efficient lookups.\n3. Iteratively try to add strings to the NG list that cover the most uncovered product names without introducing new substrings not already used.\n4. Use a greedy algorithm to find a minimum number of strings that cover all product names.\n5. Ensure that each added string to the NG list does not contain any length-2 substring that is not an already used product name.\n6.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires performing a specific operation K times on a given permutation P of numbers from 1 to N. The operation involves updating each P_i to P_{P_i} for i from 1 to N. The goal is to print the permutation P after all operations.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^18\n- 1 \u2264 P_i \u2264 N for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N\n- P_i \u2260 P_j for 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N\n- All input values are integers.\n\nInput: N, K, and the permutation P.\nOutput: The permutation P after K operations.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The operation can be represented as a graph or cycle, and understanding the cycle length for each element is crucial for efficient computation.\n- Directly applying the operation K times is not feasible for large K.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n- The operation can create cycles in the permutation.\n- Understanding the cycle length for each element is essential for efficient computation.\n- The permutation can be decomposed into cycles.\n- For any element P_i, applying the operation repeatedly will eventually bring it back to itself, forming a cycle.\n- The cycle length for each element can be found by traversing the permutation.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n- The cyclical nature of the permutation under the given operation.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n- Finding the cycle decomposition of the permutation.\n- Determining the effect of K operations on each cycle.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n- Directly applying the operation K times is not feasible for large K.\n- The operation can be applied by understanding the cycle structure of the permutation.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Sample Input 1: N = 6, K = 3, P = [5, 6, 3, 1, 2, 4]\n- Sample Input 2: N = 5, K = 1000000000000000000, P = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1.

For each element in a cycle of length L, after K operations, its new position can be determined by (K % L).\n6. Apply the operation K times using the cycle structure.\n7. Print the resulting permutation P after K operations.\n\nCritical details:\n\n- Use a visited array to keep track of elements that have been visited.\n- For each unvisited element, find its cycle and apply the operation K times.\n- Use the cycle length to efficiently compute the new position of each element.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases:\n\n- Handle large K by using the cycle length to reduce the number of operations.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef apply_operations(N, K, P):\n    # Find cycles in the permutation\n    visited = [False] * (N + 1)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            cycle = []\n            j = i\n            while not visited[j]:\n                visited[j] = True\n                cycle.append(j)\n                j = P[j - 1]\n            result.append(cycle)\n    \n    # Apply K operations\n    final_P = [0] * N\n    for cycle in result:\n        L = len(cycle)\n        for i, node in enumerate(cycle):\n            # Calculate the new position after K operations\n            new_pos = (i + K) % L\n            final_P[cycle[new_pos] - 1] = P[node - 1]\n    \n    return final_P\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        P = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n        final_P = apply_operations(N, K, P)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, final_P)))\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the K_i-th character from the beginning of a string S after performing a specific operation 10^{100} times. The operation involves changing uppercase letters in S to lowercase, and lowercase letters to uppercase, then concatenating S and the modified string T in this order to form a new S.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The initial string S consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters, with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive.\n- The number of queries Q and the query indices K_i are integers.\n- 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 2 * 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 K_i \u2264 10^{18}\n- The string S and the queries are given as input, and the answers to the queries should be printed to the output.\n\nInput: The initial string S, the number of queries Q, and the query indices K_i.\nOutput: The characters at the K_i-th positions in the final string S after all operations are completed.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The operation is performed 10^{100} times, which implies that the length of the string S will be multiplied by 2^{100}.\n- The queries K_i can be larger than the length of the initial string S.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n- The operation of changing case and concatenating can be represented as S + swap_case(S), where swap_case(S) denotes the string obtained by swapping the case of each character in S.\n- After one operation, the string becomes S + swap_case(S).\n- After two operations, the string becomes S + swap_case(S) + S + swap_case(S).\n- This process can be repeated 10^{100} times, but the key observation is that the string S will be repeated and interleaved with its swapped case version.\n- The length of the string after n operations is 2^n * len(S).\n- The character at position K_i can be found by determining which part of the string (original or swapped case) it falls into and then calculating its position within that part.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n- The interleaving pattern of the original string and its swapped case version.\n- The property that the length of the string doubles after each operation.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n- The example with S = aB and K_i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.\n- The example with S = qWeRtYuIoP and K_i = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the initial string S, the number of queries Q, and the query indices K_i from the input.\n2. Calculate the length of the initial string S.\n3. For each query K_i, determine the operation number n such that the K_i-th character falls within the string after n operations.\n4. Calculate the position of the K_i-th character within the string after n operations.\n5. Determine whether the K_i-th character falls into the original string part or the swapped case part.\n6. Calculate the character at the K_i-th position by swapping the case of the character at the corresponding position in the original string if necessary.\n7. Print the characters at the K_i-th positions to the output.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- Handling large query indices K_i by using the property that the length of the string doubles after each operation.\n- Optimizing the calculation of the operation number n and the position of the K_i-th character within the string after n operations.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef swap_case(s):\n    return s.swapcase()\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        Q = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        K_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n\n        len_S = len(S)\n\n        answers = []\n        for K in K_list:\n            n = 0\n            temp_len = len_S\n            while temp_len < K:\n                temp_len *= 2\n                n += 1\n\n            pos = K - 1\n            for _ in range(n):\n                if pos < len_S:\n                    char = S[pos]\n                    answers.append(char)\n                    break\n                else:\n                    pos -= len_S\n                    if pos < len_S:\n                        char = swap_case(S[pos])\n                        answers.append(char)\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        pos %= len_S\n            else:\n                if pos < len_S:\n                    char = S[pos]\n                    answers.append(char)\n                else:\n                    char = swap_case(S[pos - len_S])\n                    answers.append(char)\n\n        print(' '.join(answers))\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

The game ends when one player cannot make a move, and the other player wins.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 1 \u2264 N, M, L\n* N + M + L \u2264 12\n* 1 \u2264 A_i, B_i, C_i \u2264 10^9\n* All input values are integers.\n* The game always ends in a finite number of moves.\n\nInput:\n\n* N, M, L (number of cards for each player and on the table)\n* A_1, ..., A_N (Takahashi's cards)\n* B_1, ..., B_M (Aoki's cards)\n* C_1, ..., C_L (cards on the table)\n\nOutput:\n\n* The winner of the game, either \"Takahashi\" or \"Aoki\".\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The players play optimally.\n* The game state is fully observable.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* The game can be represented as a tuple of three lists: Takahashi's hand, Aoki's hand, and the cards on the table.\n* A recursive approach with memoization can be used to consider all possible moves and their outcomes.\n* The game state can be explored by simulating each player's turn and checking if they can make a move.\n* If a player cannot make a move, they lose.\n* The game can be won by the player who forces their opponent into a state where they cannot make a move.\n* The optimal strategy involves considering all possible moves and their outcomes.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* Sample Input 1: N = 1, M = 1, L = 2, A = [2], B = [4], C = [1, 3]\n* Sample Input 2: N = 4, M = 4, L = 4, A = [98, 98765, 987654, 987654321], B = [987, 9876, 9876543, 98765432], C = [123, 12345, 1234567, 123456789]\n* Sample Input 3: N = 1, M = 1, L = 8, A = [10], B = [10], C = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1.

The tiles are defined by integer triples (i, j, k) and have specific placement rules based on the parity of i and j.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^4 (number of test cases)\n- 2 \u2264 K \u2264 10^16 (size of the tile)\n- -10^16 \u2264 S_x, S_y, T_x, T_y \u2264 10^16 (coordinates of the starting and target points)\n- All input values are integers.\n- The starting and target points are at the center of their respective tiles.\n\nInput: T (number of test cases), followed by T cases, each with K, S_x, S_y, T_x, T_y.\nOutput: The minimum number of moves to an adjacent tile to reach the target tile from the starting tile for each test case.\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n- The movement is between tiles, and two tiles are adjacent when their edges have a common segment of positive length.\n- The starting and target points are at the center of their respective tiles.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The tile coordinates (i, j, k) can be determined from the given points (S_x + 0.5, S_y + 0.5) and (T_x + 0.5, T_y + 0.5) using the provided rules.\n- The parity of i and j determines the placement rule for the tile.\n- The minimum number of moves can be calculated using the Manhattan distance or a similar metric that accounts for the movement rules between tiles.\n- The difference in i, j, and k coordinates between the starting and target tiles gives the minimum number of moves.\n- The movement rules imply that the minimum number of moves is the sum of the absolute differences in i, j, and k coordinates.\n\nCritical examples and test cases:\n\n- The first test case: K = 3, S_x = -2, S_y = 1, T_x = 4, T_y = -1.\n- This example illustrates the process of finding the starting and target tiles and calculating the minimum number of moves.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1.

The goal is to permute sequence B to minimize the sum of the minimum possible path weights between corresponding vertices in sequences A and B.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The graph is connected and undirected.\n* The graph has N vertices and M edges, where 2 \u2264 N \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5 and N-1 \u2264 M \u2264 min(N \u00d7 (N-1)/2, 2 \u00d7 10^5).\n* Each edge has a weight, and the weights are integers between 1 and 10^9.\n* Sequences A and B have the same length, K, where 1 \u2264 K \u2264 N.\n* The vertices in sequences A and B are distinct, and each vertex is between 1 and N.\n* The input values are integers.\n\nInput:\n\n* The number of vertices, N, the number of edges, M, and the length of sequences A and B, K.\n* The edges of the graph, represented as pairs of vertices and their corresponding weights.\n* Sequences A and B.\n\nOutput:\n\n* The minimum possible sum of path weights between corresponding vertices in sequences A and B.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The graph is simple, meaning there are no multiple edges between any two vertices.\n* The graph is connected, meaning there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The problem can be solved by finding the minimum possible path weights between all pairs of vertices in the graph.\n* The minimum possible path weight between two vertices can be found using a union-find data structure and sorting the edges by their weights.\n* The union-find data structure can be used to keep track of the connected components in the graph.\n* Sorting the edges by their weights allows us to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph.\n* The minimum spanning tree can be used to find the minimum possible path weights between all pairs of vertices.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The properties of connected undirected graphs, specifically the existence of a path between every pair of vertices.\n* The properties of minimum spanning trees, specifically that they are subgraphs that connect all vertices with the minimum total edge weight.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* Using a union-find data structure to keep track of the connected components in the graph.\n* Sorting the edges by their weights to find the minimum spanning tree.\n* Using the minimum spanning tree to find the minimum possible path weights between all pairs of vertices.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* The problem can be solved by finding the minimum possible path weights between all pairs of vertices in the graph.\n* The minimum possible path weight between two vertices can be found using a union-find data structure and sorting the edges by their weights.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example given in the problem statement, where the graph has 4 vertices and 4 edges, and sequences A and B have length 3.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum number of vertices that must be deleted from a given tree T with N vertices to transform it into a single Snowflake Tree. A Snowflake Tree is defined by a central vertex connected to x other vertices, each of which is then connected to y leaves.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The input tree T has N vertices, numbered 1 to N.\n- The tree is given by N-1 edges, each connecting two vertices u_i and v_i.\n- The goal is to delete zero or more vertices and their adjacent edges to make the remaining graph a single Snowflake Tree.\n- The input tree can already be a Snowflake Tree, in which case no vertices need to be deleted.\n- The problem guarantees that it is always possible to transform T into a Snowflake Tree.\n- The number of vertices N is between 3 and 3 * 10^5.\n- The given graph is a tree, and all input values are integers.\n\nInput: The number of vertices N, followed by N-1 lines of edges (u_i, v_i).\nOutput: The minimum number of vertices that must be deleted to transform T into a Snowflake Tree.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions, implying that the solution should be optimized for this criterion.\n- The definition of a Snowflake Tree implies that the central vertex and the x vertices it connects to are distinct.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- A Snowflake Tree has a central vertex connected to x other vertices, each of which is then connected to y leaves.\n- To transform T into a Snowflake Tree, we need to find a central vertex and then partition the rest of the tree into x groups, each of which can be transformed into y leaves connected to a vertex in the group.\n- The problem can be approached by iterating over all possible central vertices and calculating the minimum number of deletions needed to transform T into a Snowflake Tree with that central vertex.\n- The tree can be traversed using DFS or BFS to explore the structure and find potential central vertices and leaf nodes.\n- For each potential central vertex, we need to calculate the number of vertices to delete to make the tree a Snowflake Tree.\n- The problem can be solved by simulating the process of deleting vertices and checking if the remaining graph is a Snowflake Tree.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- The given tree is already a Snowflake Tree.\n- The given tree can be transformed into a Snowflake Tree by deleting a single vertex.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input and construct the tree T.\n2. Iterate over all possible central vertices in T.\n3. For each central vertex, iterate over possible values of x and y that could result in a Snowflake Tree.\n4. For each (x, y) pair, calculate the minimum number of deletions needed to transform T into a Snowflake Tree.\n5. Use DFS or BFS to traverse the tree and explore the structure.\n6. For each potential central vertex, calculate the number of vertices to delete to make the tree a Snowflake Tree.\n7. Keep track of the minimum number of deletions found so far.\n8. Output the minimum number of deletions needed to transform T into a Snowflake Tree.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases:\n\n- Handle the case where the given tree is already a Snowflake Tree.\n- Optimize the solution by pruning branches that are guaranteed to result in a larger number of deletions.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]\n        for _ in range(N - 1):\n            u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            u -= 1\n            v -= 1\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        def is_snowflake_tree(graph, root, x, y):\n            if len(graph[root]) != x:\n                return False\n            \n            children = graph[root]\n            valid_children = 0\n            for child in children:\n                child_leaves = 0\n                queue = deque([(child, child)])\n                visited = set()\n                while queue:\n                    node, parent = queue.popleft()\n                    if node in visited:\n                        continue\n                    visited.add(node)\n                    if len(graph[node]) == 1 and node != root:\n                        child_leaves += 1\n                    for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                        if neighbor != parent:\n                            queue.append((neighbor, node))\n                if child_leaves == y:\n                    valid_children += 1\n            return valid_children == x\n        \n        min_deletions = N\n        for potential_root in range(N):\n            for x in range(1, N):\n                for y in range(1, N):\n                    deletions = 0\n                    new_graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        new_graph[i] = graph[i][:]\n                    \n                    queue = deque([potential_root])\n                    visited = set()\n                    while queue:\n                        node = queue.popleft()\n                        if node in visited:\n                            continue\n                        visited.add(node)\n                        if node != potential_root and len(new_graph[node]) > y:\n                            deletions += len(new_graph[node]) - y\n                            new_graph[node] = []\n                        for neighbor in new_graph[node]:\n                            queue.append(neighbor)\n                            new_graph[neighbor].remove(node)\n                    \n                    if len(new_graph[potential_root]) == x:\n                        valid = True\n                        children = new_graph[potential_root]\n                        for child in children:\n                            child_leaves = 0\n                            queue = deque([(child, child)])\n                            visited = set()\n                            while queue:\n                                node, parent = queue.popleft()\n                                if node in visited:\n                                    continue\n                                visited.add(node)\n                                if len(new_graph[node]) == 1 and node != potential_root:\n                                    child_leaves += 1\n                                for neighbor in new_graph[node]:\n                                    if neighbor != parent:\n                                        queue.append((neighbor, node))\n                            if child_leaves != y:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                        if valid:\n                            min_deletions = min(min_deletions, deletions)\n        print(min_deletions)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

The first line contains two integers N and X, and the second line contains N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.\n\nOutput: If a triple (i, j, k) exists that satisfies the conditions, the output should be the indices i, j, k in the format \"i j k\". If no such triple exists, the output should be -1.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The indices i, j, k are 1-based, meaning they start from 1 instead of 0.\n- The output should be in the exact format specified.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- A brute force approach would be inefficient due to its O(N^3) time complexity.\n- A two-pointer technique can be used to find the triple in O(N^2) time complexity.\n- Sorting the sequence A can help in applying the two-pointer technique.\n- Storing the original indices of the elements is necessary to map them back to their original positions.\n- The two-pointer technique involves fixing one element and using two pointers to find a pair of elements that sum up to the remaining value.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Sample Input 1: N = 5, X = 16, A = [1, 8, 5, 10, 13]\n- Sample Input 2: N = 5, X = 20, A = [1, 8, 5, 10, 13]\n- Sample Input 3: N = 10, X = 100000, A = [73766, 47718, 74148, 49218, 76721, 31902, 21994, 18880, 29598, 98917]\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1.

Create a list of tuples containing the value and original index of each element in A.\n4. Sort the list of tuples based on the values.\n5. Iterate over the sorted list:\n   - For each element, use two pointers to find a pair of elements that sum up to X - A_i.\n   - Initialize two pointers, j and k, to the next element and the last element of the remaining list.\n   - While j < k, calculate the sum A_i + A_j + A_k.\n   - If the sum equals X, return the indices i, j, k.\n   - If the sum is less than X, move j to the next element.\n   - If the sum is greater than X, move k to the previous element.\n6.

Read the number of test cases (T) and iterate over each test case.\n2. For each test case, read the number of boxes (N) and types of balls (M).\n3. Read the capacity and cost of each box.\n4. Sort the boxes by their cost per unit of capacity in ascending order.\n5. Initialize the total earnings for Mr. Box to 0.\n6. Iterate over the sorted boxes and calculate the total earnings for Mr. Box.\n7. For each box, if its capacity is 1, Mr. Box can earn 1 yen per ball of the same type he accepts.\n8.

The state becomes (4, 13, [13]).\n\nThere are no slimes adjacent to him that are strictly smaller than him, so he cannot perform any more actions.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the maximum size that each slime can have after performing a certain action any number of times. The action involves choosing a slime adjacent to the current slime that is strictly smaller than the current slime and absorbing it. The absorbed slime disappears, and the current slime's size increases by the size of the absorbed slime.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* There are N slimes lined up in a row from left to right.\n* Each slime has a size A_i.\n* The action can be performed any number of times.\n* The absorbed slime disappears, and the gap is immediately closed.\n* The slimes that were adjacent to the disappearing slime become adjacent.\n* 2 \u2264 N \u2264 5 \u00d7 10^5\n* 1 \u2264 A_i \u2264 10^9\n* All input values are integers.\n\nInput: The number of slimes N and the sizes of the slimes A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.\nOutput: The maximum size that each slime can have after performing the action any number of times.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem requires finding the maximum size for each slime, not just the maximum size overall.\n* The action can only be performed on adjacent slimes.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The problem can be solved using a stack-based approach.\n* The stack can be used to keep track of the slimes and their sizes.\n* The maximum size of each slime can be calculated by iterating through the slimes and using the stack to keep track of the slimes that can be absorbed.\n* The problem requires considering the slimes to the left and right of each slime separately.\n* The maximum size of each slime is the maximum size it can have after absorbing all the smaller slimes to its left and right.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem uses the concept of a stack to keep track of the slimes and their sizes.\n* The problem uses the property that the maximum size of each slime can be calculated by considering the slimes to its left and right separately.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* The algorithm uses a stack-based approach to keep track of the slimes and their sizes.\n* The algorithm iterates through the slimes and uses the stack to calculate the maximum size of each slime.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* The problem requires considering the slimes to the left and right of each slime separately.\n* The maximum size of each slime is the maximum size it can have after absorbing all the smaller slimes to its left and right.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example in the problem statement illustrates the concept of absorbing smaller slimes to increase the size of the current slime.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the input from stdin.\n2. Initialize an empty stack.\n3. Iterate through the slimes from left to right.\n4. For each slime, calculate the maximum size it can have by considering the slimes to its left and right separately.\n5. Use the stack to keep track of the slimes that can be absorbed.\n6. Calculate the maximum size of each slime by popping the stack and adding the sizes of the absorbed slimes.\n7. Store the maximum size of each slime in an array.\n8. Iterate through the slimes from right to left and calculate the maximum size of each slime by considering the slimes to its right.\n9. Update the maximum size of each slime in the array.\n10. Write the maximum size of each slime to stdout.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* The algorithm uses a stack-based approach to keep track of the slimes and their sizes, which reduces the time complexity of the algorithm.\n* The algorithm iterates through the slimes from left to right and right to left to calculate the maximum size of each slime, which ensures that all possible absorptions are considered.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_slime_size(N, A):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the maximum size for each slime.\n\n    Args:\n    N (int): The number of slimes.\n    A (list): The sizes of the slimes.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The maximum sizes for each slime.\n    \"\"\"\n    def max_size(slimes):\n        stack = []\n        result = [0] * len(slimes)\n        for i, slime in enumerate(slimes):\n            while stack and stack[-1][0] < slime:\n                stack.pop()\n            if stack:\n                result[i] = stack[-1][1] + slime\n            else:\n                result[i] = slime\n            stack.append((slime, result[i]))\n        return result\n\n    # Calculate maximum size for left and right\n    left_max_sizes = max_size(A)\n    right_max_sizes = max_size(A[::-1])[::-1]\n\n    # Calculate final maximum sizes\n    max_sizes = []\n    for i in range(N):\n        max_size = A[i]\n        if i > 0:\n            max_size = max(max_size, left_max_sizes[i-1] + A[i])\n        if i < N - 1:\n            max_size = max(max_size, right_max_sizes[i+1] + A[i])\n        max_sizes.append(max_size)\n\n    return max_sizes\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        A = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n        max_sizes = max_slime_size(N, A)\n        print(*max_sizes)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
