The space complexity is O(m)."

The game consists of n rounds where Alice and Bob summon one of three magical creatures each round: a Fire Dragon (F), a Water Serpent (W), or an Earth Golem (E). The points are awarded based on the rules: \n- If one player summons a Fire Dragon and the other summons an Earth Golem, the player who summoned the Fire Dragon is awarded a point.\n- If one player summons a Water Serpent and the other summons a Fire Dragon, the player who summoned the Water Serpent is awarded a point.\n- If one player summons an Earth Golem and the other summons a Water Serpent, the player who summoned the Earth Golem is awarded a point.\n- If both players summon the same creature, no player is awarded a point.\n\nThe key constraints and edge cases are:\n- Bob will never summon the same creature in two consecutive rounds.\n- The length of the sequence s is between 1 and 1000.\n- Each character in s is one of 'F', 'W', or 'E'.\n- The answer may be very large, so it needs to be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nThe input is a string s consisting of n characters 'F', 'W', and 'E', representing the sequence of creatures Alice will summon in each round.

The task is to return the total number of possible ways the event can take place, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 <= n, x, y <= 1000\n- The order of performers on a stage does not matter.\n- Two events are considered different if any performer is assigned a different stage or if any band is awarded a different score.\n- Some stages might remain empty.\n\nInput: Three integers n, x, and y.\nOutput: The total number of possible ways the event can take place, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem statement implies that each performer can only be assigned to one stage.\n- The score for each band is independent of the other bands.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be broken down into two parts: assigning stages to performers and awarding scores to bands.\n- The number of ways to assign n performers to x stages can be calculated using the formula x^n, because each performer has x choices of stages.\n- The number of ways to award scores to bands is y^k, where k is the number of non-empty stages.\n- The total number of ways to assign performers to stages and then award scores to bands is the product of the number of ways to assign stages and the number of ways to award scores.\n- The problem requires considering all possible distributions of performers into bands (non-empty stages) and calculating the number of ways for each distribution.\n- The distribution of performers into bands can be represented by a vector [b1, b2, ..., bx] where bi is the number of performers assigned to stage i.\n- The number of ways to assign performers to stages for a given distribution [b1, b2, ..., bx] is given by the multinomial coefficient n! / (b1! * b2! * ... * bx!).\n- For each distribution, the number of ways to award scores to bands is y^k, where k is the number of non-empty stages.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Example 1: n = 1, x = 2, y = 3.

Iterate over possible frequencies that can make the string \"good\", considering the total length of the string and the number of unique characters.\n3.

Initialize a variable k to 1.\n2. Iterate over possible values of k and calculate 2^k - 1.\n3. Check if 2^k - 1 >= n.\n4. If the condition is satisfied, return 2^k - 1 as the smallest number x greater than or equal to n with only set bits in its binary representation.\n5. If the condition is not satisfied, increment k and repeat steps 2-4.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases:\n\n* The loop can be optimized by using a while loop that continues until 2^k - 1 >= n.\n* The solution can be implemented using a simple iterative approach.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def smallestNumber(self, n: int) -> int:\n        k = 1\n        while True:\n            num = (1 << k) - 1\n            if num >= n:\n                return num\n            k += 1\n```\nThis solution works by shifting 1 to the left by k places and then subtracting 1, which gives a number with k ones in its binary representation. It increments k until it finds a number that is greater than or equal to n. \n\nAlternatively, you can use math.log2 to find the number of bits required to represent n, and then calculate the smallest number with that many bits set to 1.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass Solution:\n    def smallestNumber(self, n: int) -> int:\n        k = math.ceil(math.log2(n + 1))\n        return (1 << k) - 1\n```\nThis solution works by finding the smallest k such that 2^k - 1 >= n. The math.log2 function is used to find the number of bits required to represent n + 1, and then 1 is shifted to the left by that many places and subtracted by 1 to get the smallest number with that many bits set to 1. \n\nBoth solutions have a time complexity of O(log n) due to the while loop or the math.log2 function."

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the number of different special subsequences in a given array of positive integers. A special subsequence is defined as a subsequence of length 4, represented by indices (p, q, r, s), where p < q < r < s, and the product of the elements at indices p and r is equal to the product of the elements at indices q and s. Additionally, there must be at least one element between each pair of indices, i.e., q - p > 1, r - q > 1, and s - r > 1.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The length of the input array is between 7 and 1000.\n* Each element in the array is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.\n* The subsequence must have a length of 4.\n* There must be at least one element between each pair of indices.\n\nInput: An array of positive integers.\nOutput: The number of different special subsequences in the array.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem requires counting distinct special subsequences, not the total number of subsequences.\n* The order of the indices matters, i.e., (p, q, r, s) is different from (q, p, r, s).\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The problem can be solved by iterating over all possible indices p, q, r, and s.\n* The product of the elements at indices p and r must be equal to the product of the elements at indices q and s.\n* The conditions q - p > 1, r - q > 1, and s - r > 1 must be satisfied.\n* A hashmap can be used to store the count of pairs (p, r) and their products.\n* The count of special subsequences can be incremented by the count of pairs (q, s) that have the same product.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem uses the property that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of two other numbers.\n* The problem uses the property that the indices must be in increasing order.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* The problem can be solved using a brute force approach, but it would be inefficient.\n* A more efficient approach is to use a hashmap to store the count of pairs (p, r) and their products.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* The problem requires iterating over all possible indices p, q, r, and s.\n* The conditions q - p > 1, r - q > 1, and s - r > 1 must be satisfied.\n* A hashmap can be used to store the count of pairs (p, r) and their products.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 6, 1] helps to understand the problem.\n* The example [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4] helps to understand the problem.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Initialize a hashmap to store the count of pairs (i, j) and their products.\n2. Iterate over all possible indices i in the array.\n3. For each index i, iterate over all possible indices j such that j > i + 1.\n4. Calculate the product of the elements at indices i and j.\n5. Check if the product is already in the hashmap.\n6. If the product is in the hashmap, increment the count of special subsequences by the count of pairs (p, r) that have the same product.\n7. Add the pair (i, j) and its product to the hashmap.\n8. Return the count of special subsequences.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* The conditions q - p > 1, r - q > 1, and s - r > 1 must be satisfied.\n* The hashmap must be updated correctly to avoid counting duplicate special subsequences.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfSubsequences(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        count = 0\n        product_count = {}\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 2, n):\n                product = nums[i] * nums[j]\n                if product not in product_count:\n                    product_count[product] = 0\n                count += product_count[product]\n                for k in range(i + 1, j):\n                    if nums[k] * nums[j] == product:\n                        product_count[product] += 1\n\n        return count\n```"

Each bag contains a certain number of coins, and the information about the bags is given in a 2D array coins, where coins[i] = [l_i, r_i, c_i] denotes that every bag from l_i to r_i contains c_i coins.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The segments that coins contain are non-overlapping.\n- 1 <= coins.length <= 10^5\n- 1 <= k <= 10^9\n- 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9\n- 1 <= c_i <= 1000\n\nInput: A 2D array coins and an integer k.\nOutput: The maximum amount of coins that can be obtained by collecting k consecutive bags.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The bags are on a number line, implying that the positions of the bags are integers.\n- The segments of coins are non-overlapping, which means that each bag can be associated with at most one segment.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be solved using a sliding window approach.\n- A prefix sum array can be used to efficiently calculate the total number of coins in a range of bags.\n- The prefix sum array can be created by iterating over the coins array and updating the prefix sum array accordingly.\n- For each bag, we need to find out how many segments it belongs to and add the corresponding number of coins to the prefix sum array.\n- A hash map can be used to store the segments and their corresponding coin values, but it's not necessary.\n- A binary search can be used to find the segments that the current bag belongs to, but it's not necessary.\n- The maximum number of coins can be obtained by sliding a window of size k over the prefix sum array and calculating the sum of coins in each window.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- coins = [[8,10,1],[1,3,2],[5,6,4]], k = 4\n- coins = [[1,10,3]], k = 2\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Create a new array to store the ranges and their corresponding coin values.\n2. Sort the ranges by their start value.\n3. Create a prefix sum array by iterating over the ranges and updating the prefix sum array accordingly.\n4. For each range, add the coin value to the prefix sum array at the start position and subtract the coin value from the prefix sum array at the end position + 1.\n5. Calculate the prefix sum array by iterating over the array and adding the value at each position to the value at the previous position.\n6. Initialize two pointers, left and right, to 0 and k-1, respectively.\n7. Calculate the sum of coins in the window by subtracting the prefix sum at the left position from the prefix sum at the right position + 1.\n8. Move the window to the right by incrementing the left and right pointers.\n9. Keep track of the maximum sum of coins in the window.\n10.

The input consists of the number of toys (N), the sizes of the toys (A), and the sizes of the existing boxes (B). The goal is to determine the smallest possible size of the new box, denoted as x, such that all toys can be placed into separate boxes.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 2 \u2264 N \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5\n* 1 \u2264 A_i, B_i \u2264 10^9\n* All input values are integers.\n* Each toy can only be placed in a box whose size is not less than the toy's size.\n* No box can contain two or more toys.\n\nInput: N, A, B\nOutput: The minimum size of the new box (x) if it exists, otherwise -1.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem implies that the sizes of the toys and boxes are given in a specific order, but this order does not affect the solution.\n* The problem assumes that the new box can be of any size, but the goal is to find the smallest possible size.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* Sorting the sizes of the toys and the existing boxes in ascending order makes it easier to match toys with boxes.\n* The maximum size of a toy that can be placed in an existing box is the key to determining the minimum size of the new box.\n* If a toy cannot be placed in any of the existing boxes, it must be placed in the new box.\n* The minimum size of the new box is the maximum size of the toys that cannot be placed in the existing boxes.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem uses the concept of matching toys with boxes based on their sizes.\n* The problem relies on the fact that the sizes of the toys and boxes are integers.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* Iterating through the sorted lists of toys and boxes allows for efficient matching of toys with boxes.\n* Keeping track of the maximum size of the toys that cannot be placed in the existing boxes is essential to determining the minimum size of the new box.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* The problem is not just about finding a valid solution, but about finding the optimal solution (the smallest possible size of the new box).\n* The problem requires considering all possible scenarios, including edge cases.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example with N = 4, A = [5, 2, 3, 7], and B = [6, 2, 8] illustrates the need to consider the maximum size of the toys that cannot be placed in the existing boxes.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the input from stdin: N, A, and B.\n2. Sort the sizes of the toys (A) and the existing boxes (B) in ascending order.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum size of the toys that cannot be placed in the existing boxes.\n4. Iterate through the sorted lists of toys and boxes, matching toys with boxes whenever possible.\n5. If a toy cannot be placed in any of the existing boxes, update the maximum size of the toys that cannot be placed in the existing boxes.\n6.

A piece can capture other pieces in the same row, same column, or on the same diagonal (i+j = a+b or i-j = a-b).\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^9\n* 1 \u2264 M \u2264 10^3\n* 1 \u2264 a_k \u2264 N, 1 \u2264 b_k \u2264 N (1 \u2264 k \u2264 M)\n* (a_k, b_k) \u2260 (a_l, b_l) (1 \u2264 k < l \u2264 M)\n* All input values are integers.\n\nInput: N, M, and the positions of the M existing pieces (a_k, b_k)\nOutput: The number of empty squares where a piece can be placed without being captured.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem statement implies that the grid is 1-indexed, meaning the top-left square is (1,1) and the bottom-right square is (N,N).\n* The problem requires handling large inputs, including N up to 10^9.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* A piece can be captured if it is in the same row, column, or diagonal as an existing piece.\n* The diagonals can be represented by the sum (i+j) or difference (i-j) of the coordinates.\n* The problem can be solved by tracking occupied rows, columns, and diagonals.\n* The total number of squares is N^2.\n* For each existing piece, we need to update the sets of occupied rows, columns, and diagonals.\n* After processing all existing pieces, we can calculate the number of empty squares where a piece can be placed without being captured.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem uses the properties of sets to efficiently track occupied rows, columns, and diagonals.\n* The problem uses the fact that a piece can be captured if it is in the same row, column, or diagonal as an existing piece.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* The sample input 1 with N = 8 and M = 6 existing pieces.\n* The sample input 2 with N = 10^9 and M = 1 existing piece.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the input from stdin: N, M, and the positions of the M existing pieces (a_k, b_k).\n2. Initialize sets to track occupied rows, columns, and diagonals.\n3. For each existing piece, update the sets of occupied rows, columns, and diagonals.\n4. Calculate the total number of squares that are not captured.\n5. Output the result to stdout.\n\nCritical details:\n\n* Use sets to efficiently track occupied rows, columns, and diagonals.\n* Handle large inputs by using sets and avoiding unnecessary computations.\n* Calculate the total number of squares as N^2.\n* Subtract the number of occupied squares from the total number of squares to get the result.\n\nOptimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Handle the case where N is large (up to 10^9) by using sets and avoiding unnecessary computations.\n* Handle the case where M is large (up to 10^3) by using sets to efficiently track occupied rows, columns, and diagonals.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N, M = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        occupied_rows = set()\n        occupied_cols = set()\n        occupied_diags_sum = set()\n        occupied_diags_diff = set()\n        \n        for _ in range(M):\n            a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            occupied_rows.add(a)\n            occupied_cols.add(b)\n            occupied_diags_sum.add(a + b)\n            occupied_diags_diff.add(a - b)\n        \n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            for j in range(1, N + 1):\n                if (i not in occupied_rows and \n                    j not in occupied_cols and \n                    (i + j) not in occupied_diags_sum and \n                    (i - j) not in occupied_diags_diff):\n                    count += 1\n        print(count)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

The operation involves changing uppercase letters in S to lowercase, and lowercase letters to uppercase, then concatenating S and the modified string T in this order to form a new S.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The initial string S consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters, with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive.\n- The number of queries Q and the query indices K_i are integers.\n- 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 2 * 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 K_i \u2264 10^{18}\n- The string S and the queries are given as input, and the answers to the queries should be printed to the output.\n\nInput: The initial string S, the number of queries Q, and the query indices K_i.\nOutput: The characters at the specified indices for each query.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The operation is performed 10^{100} times, which implies that the pattern of the string will repeat after a certain number of operations.\n- The string length doubles after each operation.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n- The string S will be concatenated with its modified version T in each operation, doubling its length.\n- The operation involves swapping the case of each character in S to get T, then concatenating S and T.\n- The pattern of the string will repeat after a certain number of operations.\n- The length of the string after n operations can be expressed as 2^n * L, where L is the initial length of S.\n- To find the K_i-th character after 10^{100} operations, we need to determine which part of the string (S or T) it falls into and its index within that part.\n- The character at index K_i can be found by determining if K_i falls within the first half or the second half of the final string.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n- The repeating pattern of the string after each operation.\n- The doubling of the string length after each operation.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n- We can simulate the operations and find the character at the specified index for each query.\n- We can use the properties of the string and the queries to optimize the solution.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n- We don't need to actually perform the operation 10^{100} times, as the pattern will repeat after a certain number of operations.\n- We can use the fact that the string length doubles after each operation to find the character at the specified index.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- The example given in the problem statement, where S = aB and the queries are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the initial string S, the number of queries Q, and the query indices K_i from the input.\n2. For each query K_i, determine the character at that index in the final string after 10^{100} operations.\n3. Use the properties of the string and the queries to optimize the solution.\n4. Simulate the operations and find the character at the specified index for each query.\n\nCritical details:\n\n- We need to handle the case where K_i is larger than the length of the string after 10^{100} operations.\n- We can use the fact that the string length doubles after each operation to find the character at the specified index.\n\nOptimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- We can optimize the solution by using the properties of the string and the queries.\n- We need to handle the case where K_i is larger than the length of the string after 10^{100} operations.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        S = input().strip()\n        Q = int(input().strip())\n        K_values = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n\n        L = len(S)\n        results = []\n\n        for K in K_values:\n            current_S = S\n            length = L\n            operation_count = 0\n\n            while length * 2 ** operation_count < K:\n                operation_count += 1\n\n            index_in_current_S = (K - 1) % (length * 2 ** operation_count)\n            which_S = (K - 1) // (length * 2 ** operation_count)\n\n            if which_S == 0:\n                index_in_S = index_in_current_S % length\n                char = current_S[index_in_S]\n            else:\n                index_in_T = index_in_current_S % length\n                char = swap_case(current_S[index_in_T])\n\n            results.append(char)\n\n        print(' '.join(results))\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\ndef swap_case(char):\n    if char.isupper():\n        return char.lower()\n    else:\n        return char.upper()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

The grid has H rows and W columns, and there are N horizontal bars placed on the grid. Each bar consists of L_i blocks of size 1 x 1 connected horizontally, and its leftmost block is initially at cell (R_i, C_i). The goal is to find the final positions of the bars at time t = 10^100.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 1 \u2264 H, W \u2264 2 x 10^5\n* 1 \u2264 N \u2264 2 x 10^5\n* 1 \u2264 R_i \u2264 H\n* 1 \u2264 C_i \u2264 W\n* 1 \u2264 L_i \u2264 W - C_i + 1\n* In the initial state, there is no cell occupied by two different bars.\n* All input values are integers.\n\nInput: H, W, N, and the initial positions of the bars (R_i, C_i, L_i) for i = 1 to N.\nOutput: The final positions of the bars (R'_i) at time t = 10^100.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The movement of the bars occurs at every time t = 0.5 + n for some non-negative integer n.\n* A bar moves down by one cell if it is not on the bottom row and none of the cells directly below the cells occupied by the bar is occupied by any bar.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* The problem can be solved by simulating the movement of the bars over time.\n* The key to the solution is to keep track of the occupied cells and update the positions of the bars accordingly.\n* The movement of the bars can be simulated by iterating over the bars and checking if they can move down.\n* A bar can move down if it is not on the bottom row and none of the cells directly below the cells occupied by the bar is occupied by any bar.\n* The occupied cells can be represented using a set or a similar data structure for efficient lookups.\n* The simulation can be stopped when no more bars can move down.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The sample input 1: H = 4, W = 4, N = 4, and bars are (1, 2, 3), (3, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2), (2, 4, 1).\n* The sample input 2: H = 382, W = 382, N = 3, and bars are (3, 3, 3), (8, 8, 8), (2, 2, 2).\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input from stdin: H, W, N, and the initial positions of the bars (R_i, C_i, L_i) for i = 1 to N.\n2. Initialize a data structure to represent the occupied cells.\n3. Simulate the movement of the bars over time:\n\t* Iterate over the bars and check if they can move down.\n\t* If a bar can move down, update its position and the occupied cells.\n4. Repeat step 3 until no more bars can move down.\n5. Output the final positions of the bars (R'_i) at time t = 10^100.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Use a set or a similar data structure to represent the occupied cells for efficient lookups.\n* Stop the simulation when no more bars can move down.\n* Handle the case where a bar is on the bottom row or has a cell directly below it that is occupied by another bar.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef simulate_bars(H, W, N, bars):\n    current_bars = [(r, c, l) for r, c, l in bars]\n    changed = True\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        new_bars = current_bars[:]\n        occupied_cells = set()\n        for r, c, l in current_bars:\n            for x in range(c, c + l):\n                occupied_cells.add((r, x))\n        for i in range(N):\n            r, c, l = current_bars[i]\n            if r < H:\n                can_move_down = True\n                for j in range(l):\n                    if (r + 1, c + j) in occupied_cells:\n                        can_move_down = False\n                        break\n                if can_move_down:\n                    new_bars[i] = (r + 1, c, l)\n                    changed = True\n        current_bars = new_bars\n    return [r for r, _, _ in current_bars]\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        H, W, N = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        bars = []\n        for _ in range(N):\n            R, C, L = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            bars.append((R, C, L))\n        final_positions = simulate_bars(H, W, N, bars)\n        for pos in final_positions:\n            print(pos)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the maximum possible strength of Takahashi, a slime in a grid, after performing a specific action any number of times. The action involves absorbing an adjacent slime with a strength strictly less than 1/X times Takahashi's strength, increasing Takahashi's strength by the absorbed slime's strength.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The grid has H horizontal rows and W vertical columns.\n* Each cell (i, j) initially contains a slime with strength S_{i, j}.\n* Takahashi is initially in cell (P, Q).\n* The action can be performed any number of times (possibly zero).\n* The absorbed slime disappears, and the gap is immediately filled by Takahashi.\n* The slimes that were adjacent to the disappeared slime become newly adjacent to Takahashi.\n* 1 \u2264 H, W \u2264 500\n* 1 \u2264 P \u2264 H\n* 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 W\n* 1 \u2264 X \u2264 10^9\n* 1 \u2264 S_{i, j} \u2264 10^12\n* All input values are integers.\n\nInput: H, W, X, P, Q, and the grid S.\nOutput: The maximum possible strength of Takahashi.\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n* The problem statement implies that Takahashi can only absorb slimes whose strength is strictly less than 1/X times his current strength.\n* The grid is filled with slimes, and each slime has a strength.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations:\n\n* The problem can be solved using a greedy approach or a priority queue to manage which slimes can be absorbed next.\n* The absorption process can be simulated by iterating over adjacent slimes and checking if they can be absorbed.\n* The key to the solution is to keep track of Takahashi's current strength and position, and to efficiently manage the list of adjacent slimes.\n* A priority queue can be used to store slimes that can be absorbed, ordered by their strength.\n\nPatterns or properties:\n\n* The problem uses the concept of adjacency in a grid and the idea of absorbing slimes to increase Takahashi's strength.\n* The solution relies on the property that the absorbed slime's strength is added to Takahashi's strength.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The sample inputs provided in the problem statement, such as the 3x3 grid with X = 2, help to illustrate the absorption process and the expected output.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Read the input from stdin: H, W, X, P, Q, and the grid S.\n2. Initialize Takahashi's position and strength.\n3. Initialize a priority queue or a data structure to store slimes that can be absorbed.\n4. Iterate over the grid to find adjacent slimes and check if they can be absorbed.\n5. Simulate the absorption process by updating Takahashi's strength and position.\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 until no more slimes can be absorbed.\n7. Output the maximum possible strength of Takahashi to stdout.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases:\n\n* Using a priority queue to store slimes that can be absorbed helps to efficiently manage the list of adjacent slimes.\n* Checking if a slime can be absorbed by comparing its strength to 1/X times Takahashi's current strength is a critical optimization.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport heapq\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        H, W, X = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        P, Q = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        P -= 1\n        Q -= 1\n        S = [list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(H)]\n        \n        takahashi_strength = S[P][Q]\n        takahashi_position = (P, Q)\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add(takahashi_position)\n        pq = []\n        \n        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            nx, ny = P + dx, Q + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < H and 0 <= ny < W:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (S[nx][ny], (nx, ny)))\n        \n        while pq:\n            slime_strength, slime_position = heapq.heappop(pq)\n            if slime_strength >= takahashi_strength / X:\n                break\n            else:\n                takahashi_strength += slime_strength\n                visited.add(slime_position)\n                x, y = slime_position\n                for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                    if 0 <= nx < H and 0 <= ny < W and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                        heapq.heappush(pq, (S[nx][ny], (nx, ny)))\n        print(takahashi_strength)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

A building is considered visible from a point P with coordinate x and height h if there exists a point Q on the building such that the line segment PQ does not intersect with any other building.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5, where N is the number of buildings\n- 1 \u2264 X_1 < ... < X_N \u2264 10^9, where X_i is the coordinate of building i\n- 1 \u2264 H_i \u2264 10^9, where H_i is the height of building i\n- All input values are integers\n- If it is possible to see all buildings at height 0 from coordinate 0, report -1 instead\n- The answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-9} from the true answer\n\nInput: The number of buildings N, followed by N pairs of coordinates and heights (X_i, H_i)\nOutput: The maximum height at coordinate 0 from which it is not possible to see all buildings\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n- The size of the buildings in directions other than height is negligible\n- The line segment PQ should not intersect with any other building\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- To determine if all buildings can be seen from a given height at coordinate 0, we need to check if there exists a line from (0, h) that can touch each building without intersecting any other building\n- The equation of the line from (0, h) to (x, 0) is y = -h/x * x + h, which simplifies to y = -h/x * x + h\n- For a building at (X_i, H_i) to be visible, there must be a point (X_i, y) on the building such that the line from (0, h) to (X_i, y) does not intersect any other building\n- The slope of the line from (0, h) to (X_i, H_i) is (H_i - h) / X_i\n- We need to find the maximum height h such that there exists a building that cannot be seen from (0, h)\n- A building is not visible from height h at coordinate 0 if the line from (0, h) to any point on the building intersects with another building\n- We can use a binary search approach to find the maximum height\n\nCritical examples and test cases:\n\n- Sample Input 1: 3 buildings at (3, 2), (5, 4), (7, 5)\n- Sample Input 2: 2 buildings at (1, 1), (2, 100)\n- Sample Input 3: 3 buildings at (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input from stdin and store the coordinates and heights of the buildings\n2. Check if all buildings can be seen from height 0 at coordinate 0\n3. If yes, report -1\n4. Otherwise, use a binary search approach to find the maximum height h\n5. For each mid-height in the binary search, check if all buildings can be seen from that height\n6. If yes, update the lower bound of the search range\n7. If no, update the upper bound of the search range\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until the search range is small enough\n9. Report the maximum height h\n\nImportant optimizations and special cases:\n\n- Use a binary search approach to reduce the number of iterations\n- Check if all buildings can be seen from height 0 at coordinate 0 to handle the special case\n- Handle the case where the answer is -1 separately\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef can_see_all_buildings(buildings, h):\n    slopes = []\n    for x, H in buildings:\n        if x == 0:\n            if H > h:\n                return False\n            else:\n                continue\n        slope = (H - h) / x\n        slopes.append(slope)\n    slopes.sort()\n    for i in range(len(slopes) - 1):\n        if slopes[i] > slopes[i + 1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        buildings = []\n        for _ in range(N):\n            X, H = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            buildings.append((X, H))\n        \n        def visible_from_zero(h):\n            for x, H in buildings:\n                if h * x < H * x or x == 0:\n                    if x != 0:\n                        slope_to_top = (H - h) / x\n                        blocked = False\n                        for x2, H2 in buildings:\n                            if x2 == x:\n                                continue\n                            if x2 * (H - h) >= x * H2 and x2 * h <= x * (H2 - h):\n                                blocked = True\n                                break\n                        if blocked:\n                            return False\n                    else:\n                        if H > h:\n                            return False\n            return True\n        \n        if visible_from_zero(0):\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            left, right = 0, 10**9\n            while right - left > 10**-9:\n                mid = (left + right) / 2.0\n                if visible_from_zero(mid):\n                    left = mid\n                else:\n                    right = mid\n            print(right)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

The string S is displayed on the calculator by appending the pressed button to the end of the current string.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- S is a string of length at least 1 and at most 1000, consisting of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n- The first character of S is not 0.\n- The calculator initially displays an empty string.\n\nInput: A string S.\nOutput: The minimum number of button presses required to display the string S.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem requires handling the case where a single '0' is pressed, as well as the case where '00' is pressed.\n- The problem requires iterating over the string S from the beginning to the end.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n- The string S can be displayed on the calculator by appending the pressed button to the end of the current string.\n- If the current character is '0' and the previous character is also '0', then we can press the '00' button.\n- If the current character is '0' but the previous character is not '0', then we need to press the '0' button.\n- If the current character is not '0', then we need to press the corresponding digit button.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n- The problem uses the property that the string S can be displayed on the calculator by appending the pressed button to the end of the current string.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n- The problem can be solved by iterating over the string S from the beginning to the end, and for each character, determining which button to press.\n- The problem requires keeping track of the number of button presses.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n- The problem requires handling the case where a single '0' is pressed, as well as the case where '00' is pressed.\n- The problem requires iterating over the string S from the beginning to the end.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n- The example S = 1000000007 led to the insight that we need to handle the case where a single '0' is pressed, as well as the case where '00' is pressed.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of button presses.\n2. Iterate over the string S from the beginning to the end.\n3. For each character, determine which button to press:\n   - If the current character is '0' and the previous character is also '0', then we can press the '00' button.\n   - If the current character is '0' but the previous character is not '0', then we need to press the '0' button.\n   - If the current character is not '0', then we need to press the corresponding digit button.\n4. Increment the number of button presses accordingly.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- Handle the case where a single '0' is pressed, as well as the case where '00' is pressed.\n- Iterate over the string S from the beginning to the end.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef min_button_presses(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of button presses required to display the string S on a calculator.\n    \n    Args:\n    S (str): The target string to be displayed on the calculator.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The minimum number of button presses required.\n    \"\"\"\n    presses = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(S):\n        # Check if the current character and the next one form \"00\"\n        if i + 1 < len(S) and S[i:i+2] == \"00\":\n            presses += 1\n            i += 2\n        else:\n            presses += 1\n            i += 1\n    return presses\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Read input from stdin\n        S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        # Calculate and print the result to stdout\n        result = min_button_presses(S)\n        print(result)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires determining the maximum amount of money Mr. Box can earn in a game where he buys boxes to store balls given by Mr. Ball, under certain conditions. The goal is to find the difference between Mr. Box's final and initial money when both players play optimally.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* Mr. Ball has 10^100 balls of each of M different types.\n* Mr. Box has 10^100 yen.\n* There are N boxes, each with a capacity V_i and a cost P_i yen.\n* The game involves Mr. Ball giving a ball to Mr. Box, who can accept and put it in a box, or end the game.\n* For Mr. Box to earn 1 yen, the box with the ball must not exceed its capacity and must contain balls of the same type.\n* Both players play optimally, with Mr. Ball trying to minimize Mr. Box's earnings and Mr. Box trying to maximize his earnings.\n* The number of test cases (T) is between 1 and 3*10^5.\n* The number of boxes (N) and types of balls (M) are between 1 and 3*10^5.\n* The capacity (V_i) and cost (P_i) of each box are between 1 and 10^9.\n\nInput: The number of test cases (T), followed by the number of boxes (N) and types of balls (M) for each test case, and then the capacity and cost of each box.\n\nOutput: The difference between Mr. Box's final and initial money for each test case.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* Mr. Box's initial money is large enough that he will never run out of money to buy boxes.\n* Both players have access to all information, including the capacity, price, and contents of each box.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The problem can be solved by considering the cost-effectiveness of each box.\n* The efficiency of a box can be measured by its cost per unit of capacity (P_i / V_i).\n* Sorting the boxes by their cost per unit of capacity in ascending order allows Mr. Box to prioritize buying boxes that offer the most capacity per yen.\n* Mr. Ball can prevent Mr. Box from earning money by giving balls in a way that doesn't allow Mr. Box to fill a box with the same type of ball up to its capacity.\n* The optimal strategy for Mr. Box involves buying boxes that can be filled with the same type of ball up to their capacity at the lowest cost.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem uses a greedy approach, where Mr. Box prioritizes buying the most cost-effective boxes.\n* The problem also uses a sorting approach, where the boxes are sorted by their cost per unit of capacity.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* The example in the problem statement, where Mr. Box buys box 2 for 1 yen and fills it with white balls, earning 1 yen for each of the 3 white balls.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the number of test cases (T) and iterate over each test case.\n2. For each test case, read the number of boxes (N) and types of balls (M).\n3. Read the capacity and cost of each box.\n4. Sort the boxes by their cost per unit of capacity in ascending order.\n5. Initialize the total earnings for Mr. Box to 0.\n6. Iterate over the sorted boxes and calculate the total earnings for Mr. Box.\n7. For each box, if its capacity is 1, Mr. Box can earn 1 yen for each ball of the same type that he can put in the box.\n8. If the box's capacity is greater than 1, Mr. Box can earn 1 yen for each ball of the same type that he can put in the box, up to its capacity.\n9. Print the total earnings for Mr. Box for each test case.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Handling the case where a box has a capacity of 1 and a cost of P_i.\n* Handling the case where Mr. Ball gives a ball that cannot be put in any of the boxes.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, M = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            boxes = []\n            for _ in range(N):\n                V, P = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n                boxes.append((V, P))\n            boxes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] / x[0])\n            total_earnings = 0\n            for V, P in boxes:\n                if V == 1:\n                    total_earnings += 1\n                else:\n                    if P / V <= 1:\n                        total_earnings += V\n                    else:\n                        break\n            print(total_earnings)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
