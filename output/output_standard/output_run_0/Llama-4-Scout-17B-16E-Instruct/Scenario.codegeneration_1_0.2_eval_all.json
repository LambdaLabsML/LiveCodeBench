            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the maximum number of operations that can be performed on a given string `source` such that a specified `pattern` remains a subsequence of `source` after removals. An operation is defined as removing a character at an index `idx` from `source`, where `idx` is an element of `targetIndices`, and `pattern` remains a subsequence of `source` after removing the character.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- `1 <= n == source.length <= 3 * 10^3`\n- `1 <= pattern.length <= n`\n- `1 <= targetIndices.length <= n`\n- `targetIndices` is sorted in ascending order.\n- The input is generated such that `targetIndices` contains distinct elements in the range `[0, n - 1]`.\n- `source` and `pattern` consist only of lowercase English letters.\n- The input is generated such that `pattern` appears as a subsequence in `source`.\n\nInput: `source` (string), `pattern` (string), `targetIndices` (list of integers)\nOutput: The maximum number of operations that can be performed (integer)\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The indices of the remaining characters in `source` do not change after an operation.\n- The problem guarantees that `pattern` is a subsequence of `source` initially.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be solved by iterating over `targetIndices` and checking if removing the character at the current index would still keep `pattern` as a subsequence of the modified `source`.\n- A two-pointer approach can be used to check if `pattern` is a subsequence of `source`.\n- The problem requires simulating the removal of characters at indices specified by `targetIndices` and verifying if `pattern` remains a subsequence after each removal.\n- The maximum number of operations that can be performed is the count of removals that do not affect `pattern` being a subsequence of `source`.\n- The problem can be approached by filtering `targetIndices` to only include indices where the character can be removed without affecting the subsequence property.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- `source = \"abbaa\", pattern = \"aba\", targetIndices = [0,1,2]`\n- `source = \"bcda\", pattern = \"d\", targetIndices = [0,3]`\n- `source = \"dda\", pattern = \"dda\", targetIndices = [0,1,2]`\n- `source = \"yeyeykyded\", pattern = \"yeyyd\", targetIndices = [0,2,3,4]`\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Define a function `is_subsequence` to check if `pattern` is a subsequence of `source`.\n2. Initialize a count of removals to 0.\n3. Iterate over `targetIndices` and for each index, simulate the removal of the character at that index from `source`.\n4. Check if `pattern` remains a subsequence of the modified `source` using the `is_subsequence` function.\n5. If `pattern` remains a subsequence, increment the count of removals.\n6. Return the maximum number of operations that can be performed.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases:\n\n- Convert `source` to a list for easier manipulation.\n- Use a temporary `source` to simulate removals without modifying the original string.\n- Check if the index is within the bounds of `source` before simulating removal.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxRemovals(self, source: str, pattern: str, targetIndices: List[int]) -> int:\n        def is_subsequence(source, pattern):\n            p_idx = 0\n            for char in source:\n                if p_idx < len(pattern) and char == pattern[p_idx]:\n                    p_idx += 1\n            return p_idx == len(pattern)\n\n        removals = 0\n        for idx in targetIndices:\n            temp_source = list(source)\n            if idx < len(temp_source):\n                del temp_source[idx]\n                temp_source_str = ''.join(temp_source)\n                if is_subsequence(temp_source_str, pattern):\n                    removals += 1\n        return removals\n```"

This allows it to process queries in O(log n) time using binary search.\n\nFor each query, the solution performs a binary search on the `gcd_count` list to find the GCD at the query index.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.gcdValues([2,3,4], [0,2,2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 2]\nprint(solution.gcdValues([4,4,2,1], [5,3,1,0]))  # Output: [4, 2, 1, 1]\nprint(solution.gcdValues([2,2], [0,0]))  # Output: [2, 2]\n```"

The game consists of n rounds where Alice and Bob summon one of three magical creatures each round: a Fire Dragon (F), a Water Serpent (W), or an Earth Golem (E).

The allowed operations are shifting a character in `s` to the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around to 'a' if the character is 'z') at a cost of `nextCost[j]`, or shifting a character in `s` to the previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around to 'z' if the character is 'a') at a cost of `previousCost[j]`, where `j` is the index of the character in the alphabet.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `1 <= s.length == t.length <= 10^5`\n* `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.\n* `nextCost.length == previousCost.length == 26`\n* `0 <= nextCost[i], previousCost[i] <= 10^9`\n\nInput: Two strings `s` and `t` of the same length, and two integer arrays `nextCost` and `previousCost`.\nOutput: The minimum total cost of operations required to transform `s` into `t`.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The shift distance is calculated in a circular manner, i.e., shifting from 'z' to 'a' or from 'a' to 'z' is allowed.\n* The cost of shifting a character to the next or previous letter is dependent on the index of the character in the alphabet.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* The problem can be solved by iterating over each pair of characters in `s` and `t`, calculating the minimum cost to transform the character in `s` to the character in `t`, and summing up these costs.\n* The minimum cost to transform a character in `s` to a character in `t` can be calculated by considering the circular shift and choosing the minimum cost between shifting to the next letter and shifting to the previous letter.\n* The shift distance between two characters can be calculated using the ASCII values of the characters.\n* The problem can be solved using a greedy approach, i.e., choosing the minimum cost at each step.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* `s = \"abab\", t = \"baba\", nextCost = [100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], previousCost = [1,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`\n* `s = \"leet\", t = \"code\", nextCost = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], previousCost = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Initialize the total cost to 0.\n2. Iterate over each pair of characters in `s` and `t`.\n3. For each pair of characters, calculate the shift distance between the characters in a circular manner.\n4. Calculate the minimum cost to transform the character in `s` to the character in `t` by considering the circular shift and choosing the minimum cost between shifting to the next letter and shifting to the previous letter.\n5. Add the minimum cost to the total cost.\n6. Return the total cost.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Handling the wrap-around cases when shifting from 'z' to 'a' or from 'a' to 'z'.\n* Choosing the minimum cost between shifting to the next letter and shifting to the previous letter.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shiftDistance(self, s: str, t: str, nextCost: List[int], previousCost: List[int]) -> int:\n        total_cost = 0\n        for c1, c2 in zip(s, t):\n            idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n            idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n            shift = (idx2 - idx1) % 26\n            if shift < 0:\n                shift += 26\n            cost_next = shift * nextCost[idx1]\n            cost_prev = (26 - shift) * previousCost[idx2]\n            total_cost += min(cost_next, cost_prev)\n        return total_cost\n```"

We can optimize it by only performing DFS once and storing the results.\n\n### Optimized Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findAnswer(self, parent: List[int], s: str) -> List[bool]:\n        n = len(parent)\n        # Build adjacency list\n        children = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if parent[i] != -1:\n                children[parent[i]].append(i)\n\n        def dfs(x: int) -> (str, bool):\n            \"\"\"Perform DFS from node x and return the string and whether it's a palindrome.\"\"\"\n            dfs_str = \"\"\n            is_palin = True\n            for child in children[x]:\n                child_str, child_is_palin = dfs(child)\n                dfs_str += child_str\n                is_palin = is_palin and child_is_palin\n            dfs_str += s[x]\n            is_palin = is_palin and (dfs_str == dfs_str[::-1])\n            return dfs_str, is_palin\n\n        answer = [False] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Perform DFS from node i and check if the resulting string is a palindrome\n            _, is_palin = dfs(i)\n            answer[i] = is_palin\n\n        return answer\n```\nHowever, we can still do better. Instead of reversing the string for each node, we can check if the string is a palindrome in a more efficient way.\n\n### Final Optimized Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findAnswer(self, parent: List[int], s: str) -> List[bool]:\n        n = len(parent)\n        # Build adjacency list\n        children = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if parent[i] != -1:\n                children[parent[i]].append(i)\n\n        def dfs(x: int) -> (str, bool):\n            \"\"\"Perform DFS from node x and return the string and whether it's a palindrome.\"\"\"\n            dfs_str = \"\"\n            for child in children[x]:\n                child_str, _ = dfs(child)\n                dfs_str += child_str\n            dfs_str += s[x]\n            return dfs_str, dfs_str == dfs_str[::-1]\n\n        answer = [False] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Perform DFS from node i and check if the resulting string is a palindrome\n            _, is_palin = dfs(i)\n            answer[i] = is_palin\n\n        return answer\n```\nBut the solution above still has to do a lot of repeated work because it does a separate DFS for each node. \n\n### Most Efficient Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findAnswer(self, parent: List[int], s: str) -> List[bool]:\n        n = len(parent)\n        children = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            children[parent[i]].append(i)\n\n        def dfs(x: int) -> (str, bool):\n            \"\"\"Perform DFS from node x and return the string and whether it's a palindrome.\"\"\"\n            strs = []\n            for child in children[x]:\n                str_child, is_palin_child = dfs(child)\n                strs.append((str_child, is_palin_child))\n            strs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n            dfs_str = ''.join([x[0] for x in strs]) + s[x]\n            is_palin = dfs_str == dfs_str[::-1]\n            return dfs_str, is_palin\n\n        answer = [False] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Perform DFS from node i and check if the resulting string is a palindrome\n            _, is_palin = dfs(i)\n            answer[i] = is_palin\n\n        return answer\n```\nThe solution above still has high time complexity.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the total number of possible ways an event can take place. The event involves assigning n performers to one of x stages and then awarding a score to each band (a group of performers on the same stage) from a range [1, y]. The task is to return the total number of possible ways the event can take place, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 <= n, x, y <= 1000\n- The order of performers on a stage does not matter.\n- Two events are considered different if any performer is assigned a different stage or if any band is awarded a different score.\n- Some stages might remain empty.\n\nInput: Three integers n, x, and y.\nOutput: The total number of possible ways the event can take place, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem statement implies that each performer can only be assigned to one stage.\n- The score for each band is independent of the other bands.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be broken down into two parts: assigning stages to performers and awarding scores to bands.\n- The number of ways to assign n performers to x stages can be calculated using the formula x^n, because each performer has x choices of stages.\n- The number of ways to award scores to bands is y^k, where k is the number of non-empty stages.\n- The total number of ways to assign performers to stages and then award scores to bands is the product of the number of ways to assign stages and the number of ways to award scores.\n- The problem requires considering all possible distributions of performers into bands (non-empty stages).\n- The Stirling numbers of the second kind (S(n, k)) can be used to calculate the number of ways to partition n performers into k non-empty bands.\n- The problem can be solved using dynamic programming or a similar approach to efficiently compute the number of ways.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- Example 1: n = 1, x = 2, y = 3. The output should be 6.\n- Example 2: n = 5, x = 2, y = 1. The output should be 32.\n- Example 3: n = 3, x = 3, y = 4. The output should be 684.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Initialize a variable to store the total number of ways.\n2. Calculate the number of ways to assign n performers to x stages.\n3. For each possible number of non-empty stages (k) from 1 to x, calculate the number of ways to assign n performers into k non-empty stages using the Stirling numbers of the second kind (S(n, k)).\n4. For each k, calculate the number of ways to award scores to k bands, which is y^k.\n5. For each k, calculate the number of ways to choose k stages out of x stages, which is C(x, k).\n6. Multiply the number of ways to assign performers into k bands, the number of ways to award scores to k bands, and the number of ways to choose k stages out of x stages.\n7.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to make all elements in an integer array `nums` equal to a given integer `k`. An operation involves selecting a valid integer `h` and replacing all values in `nums` that are strictly greater than `h` with `h`. A valid integer `h` is one where all values in `nums` greater than `h` are identical.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`\n* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`\n* `1 <= k <= 100`\n* If `k` is not in `nums` and `k` is greater than all elements in `nums`, it's impossible to make all elements equal to `k`.\n* If all elements in `nums` are already equal to `k`, no operations are needed.\n\nInput: An integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.\nOutput: The minimum number of operations required to make all elements in `nums` equal to `k`. If it's impossible, return -1.\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n* The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations, not just any sequence of operations that achieves the goal.\n* The validity of `h` depends on the current state of `nums`.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* A valid integer `h` can be used to reduce the values in `nums` that are greater than `h` to `h`.\n* The goal is to make all elements in `nums` equal to `k`.\n* If `k` is not in `nums` and `k` is greater than all elements in `nums`, it's impossible to make all elements equal to `k`.\n* The problem can be solved by iterating over possible values of `h` in descending order.\n* For each `h`, we need to check if it's valid and if applying it reduces the number of distinct elements greater than `k` or brings elements closer to `k`.\n* The minimum number of operations can be found by simulating the process of applying valid `h` values.\n\nCritical examples:\n\n* `nums = [5,2,5,4,5], k = 2`\n* `nums = [2,1,2], k = 2`\n* `nums = [9,7,5,3], k = 1`\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1.

Iterate over possible values of `h` in descending order, starting from the maximum element in `nums`.\n4. For each `h`, check if it's valid by verifying that all elements in `nums` greater than `h` are identical.\n5. If `h` is valid, simulate the operation by replacing all elements greater than `h` with `h` and increment the operation count.\n6.

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the number of positive integers less than a given number `n` that are `k-reducible`. A number `x` is `k-reducible` if it can be reduced to 1 by performing at most `k` operations, where each operation replaces `x` with the count of set bits in its binary representation.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* `1 <= s.length <= 800`, where `s` is the binary representation of `n`\n* `s` has no leading zeros\n* `s` consists only of the characters '0' and '1'\n* `1 <= k <= 5`\n* The answer should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`\n\nInput: A binary string `s` and an integer `k`\nOutput: The number of positive integers less than `n` that are `k-reducible`, modulo `10^9 + 7`\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n* The problem requires using a dynamic programming approach or a similar method to efficiently count the `k-reducible` numbers\n* The reduction operation involves calculating the number of set bits in the binary representation of a number\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* To determine if a number is `k-reducible`, we need to simulate the reduction process and check if it can be reduced to 1 within `k` steps\n* The reduction operation can be repeated at most `k` times\n* We can use a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the `k-reducible` numbers\n* The number of set bits in the binary representation of a number can be calculated using the `bin(x).count('1')` expression\n* We need to iterate over all positive integers less than `n` and check if each one is `k-reducible`\n\nCritical examples:\n\n* For `s = 111` and `k = 1`, the `1-reducible` integers less than 7 are 1, 2, and 4\n* For `s = 1000` and `k = 2`, the `2-reducible` integers less than 8 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Convert the binary string `s` to an integer `n`\n2. Define a function `is_k_reducible(x, k)` to check if a number `x` is `k-reducible`\n3. In the `is_k_reducible(x, k)` function, use a recursive approach with memoization to simulate the reduction process and check if `x` can be reduced to 1 within `k` steps\n4. Iterate over all positive integers less than `n` and check if each one is `k-reducible` using the `is_k_reducible(x, k)` function\n5. Count the number of `k-reducible` numbers and return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countKReducibleNumbers(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = int(s, 2)\n        memo = {}\n        \n        def count_set_bits(x):\n            return bin(x).count('1')\n        \n        def is_k_reducible(x, k, memo):\n            if (x, k) in memo:\n                return memo[(x, k)]\n            if x == 1 and k >= 0:\n                return True\n            if k == 0 or x == 1:\n                return False\n            set_bits = count_set_bits(x)\n            memo[(x, k)] = is_k_reducible(set_bits, k - 1, memo)\n            return memo[(x, k)]\n        \n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            memo.clear() # Clear memoization for each new number\n            if is_k_reducible(i, k, memo):\n                count = (count + 1) % MOD\n        return count\n```"

Initialize a difference array `diff` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.\n2. Process each query `[l, r]` by incrementing `diff[l]` by -1 and `diff[r + 1]` by 1.\n3.

The array can be converted to a zero array if the sum of decrements from all queries for each index is greater than or equal to the value at that index in the array.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n- 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5\n- 1 <= queries.length <= 10^5\n- queries[i].length == 2\n- 0 <= l_i <= r_i < nums.length\n- If it is not possible to convert nums to a zero array, return -1\n\nInput: An integer array nums and a 2D array queries where queries[i] = [l_i, r_i].\nOutput: The maximum number of elements that can be removed from queries.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The amount by which the value is decremented can be chosen independently for each index.\n- The goal is to find the maximum number of queries that can be removed while still allowing nums to be converted to a zero array.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be solved by calculating the total decrement each query can provide to the array and then determining which queries are essential to make all elements in nums zero.\n- The total number of decrements a query can provide is simply the length of its range, i.e., r_i - l_i + 1.\n- To determine if nums can be converted to a zero array using a subset of queries, we need to calculate the total decrements that can be applied to each index in nums from the remaining queries and ensure this is at least as large as the value at that index in nums.\n- A greedy approach or a binary search approach can be used to find the maximum number of removable queries.\n- The problem can be solved by simulating the process of removing queries and checking if the remaining queries can make nums a zero array.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- nums = [2,0,2], queries = [[0,2],[0,2],[1,1]]\n- nums = [1,1,1,1], queries = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]\n- nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[0,3]]\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Define a function that checks if a subset of queries can convert nums to a zero array.\n2. Use a binary search approach to find the maximum number of removable queries.\n3. Calculate the prefix sum of decrements for the remaining queries.\n4. For each index in nums, check if the total decrements from the remaining queries are sufficient to make the element zero.\n5. If the remaining queries can make nums a zero array, update the maximum number of removable queries.\n6.

Each lock requires a certain amount of energy to break, and Bob uses a sword with initial energy 0 and an initial factor X of 1. The sword's energy increases by the current factor X every minute. After breaking a lock, the sword's energy resets to 0, and the factor X increases by a given value K.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 1 <= n <= 8 (number of locks)\n* 1 <= K <= 10 (increase in factor X after breaking a lock)\n* 1 <= strength[i] <= 10^6 (energy required to break each lock)\n* The sword's initial energy is 0, and the initial factor X is 1.\n\nInput: A list of integers representing the energy required to break each lock (strength) and an integer K representing the increase in factor X after breaking a lock.\n\nOutput: The minimum time in minutes required to break all n locks.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The sword's energy increases by the current factor X every minute.\n* After breaking a lock, the sword's energy resets to 0, and the factor X increases by K.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The sword's energy at time t is given by the formula E(t) = (t * (t + 1)) // 2 * X, but this formula needs to be adjusted based on the current factor X and the time elapsed since the last lock was broken.\n* The problem can be solved using a recursive or iterative approach with backtracking to explore all possible sequences of breaking locks.\n* The sword's energy increases by the current factor X every minute, and after breaking a lock, the sword's energy resets to 0, and the factor X increases by K.\n* The problem requires finding the minimum time required to break all locks, considering the dynamics of energy increase and lock breaking.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The sword's energy increases quadratically with time.\n* The factor X increases linearly with the number of locks broken.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* Example 1: strength = [3,4,1], K = 1, output = 4\n* Example 2: strength = [2,5,4], K = 2, output = 5\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1.

If the energy required is greater than the current energy, increment the time and update the energy accordingly.\n5.

An empty array is considered to have distinct elements.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The array length is between 1 and 100.\n- Each element in the array is an integer between 1 and 100.\n- The array may already have distinct elements.\n- The array may have fewer than 3 elements.\n- The operation can be performed any number of times.\n\nInput: An integer array `nums`.\nOutput: The minimum number of operations needed to make the elements in the array distinct.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem statement implies that the order of elements in the array matters, as the operation removes elements from the beginning of the array.\n- The problem statement does not explicitly state that the array cannot be modified in-place, but the solution approach suggests that a new data structure can be used.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The problem can be solved by iterating over the array and checking for distinctness in a sliding window of elements that are not removed yet.\n- A set data structure can be used to efficiently check for duplicates in the current window of non-removed elements.\n- When a duplicate is found, removing the first 3 elements from the current window may make the remaining elements distinct.\n- The process of removing 3 elements and checking for distinctness can be repeated until the array has distinct elements or is empty.\n- The minimum number of operations is the number of times 3 elements are removed from the beginning of the array.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- `nums = [1,2,3,4,2,3,3,5,7]`: This example illustrates the need to remove 3 elements multiple times to make the array distinct.\n- `nums = [4,5,6,4,4]`: This example shows that removing 3 elements twice can make the array empty, which is considered distinct.\n- `nums = [6,7,8,9]`: This example demonstrates that if the array already has distinct elements, no operations are needed.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of operations.\n2. Initialize a set to keep track of unique elements in the current window.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the start of the current window.\n4. Iterate over the array, adding each element to the set and checking if it is a duplicate.\n5. If a duplicate is found, remove the first 3 elements from the current window and increment the operation count.\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 until the array has distinct elements or is empty.\n7. Return the minimum number of operations.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        operations = 0\n        left = 0\n        \n        while left < n:\n            seen = set()\n            while left < n and nums[left] in seen:\n                left += 1\n                operations += 1\n            if left >= n:\n                break\n            seen.add(nums[left])\n            right = left + 1\n            while right < n and nums[right] not in seen:\n                seen.add(nums[right])\n                right += 1\n            left = right\n            if right < n and nums[right] in seen:\n                continue\n        return operations\n```"

Filter out the non-missing elements from the array and store them in a list.\n2. If all elements in the array are missing, return 0.\n3. Calculate the minimum and maximum values of the non-missing elements.\n4. Initialize the minimum difference to infinity.\n5. Iterate through the non-missing elements and calculate the maximum absolute difference for each possible pair of x and y.\n6. Update the minimum difference if a smaller difference is found.\n7. Consider the case where x and y are equal to the minimum or maximum non-missing elements.\n8. Return the minimum difference.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- Handle the case where all elements in the array are missing.\n- Handle the case where there is only one non-missing element in the array.\n- Optimize the iteration through possible values of x and y by only considering the non-missing elements.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        non_missing = [num for num in nums if num != -1]\n        if len(non_missing) == 0:\n            return 0\n        if len(non_missing) == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        min_val = min(non_missing)\n        max_val = max(non_missing)\n        \n        min_diff = float('inf')\n        \n        for x in range(min_val, max_val + 1):\n            y = x + 1\n            if y > max_val:\n                continue\n            current_nums = []\n            for num in nums:\n                if num == -1:\n                    current_nums.append(x)\n                else:\n                    current_nums.append(num)\n            # or use y\n            current_nums_y = []\n            for num in nums:\n                if num == -1:\n                    current_nums_y.append(y)\n                else:\n                    current_nums_y.append(num)\n            \n            diff = 0\n            for i in range(len(current_nums) - 1):\n                diff = max(diff, abs(current_nums[i] - current_nums[i+1]))\n            diff_y = 0\n            for i in range(len(current_nums_y) - 1):\n                diff_y = max(diff_y, abs(current_nums_y[i] - current_nums_y[i+1]))\n            min_diff = min(min_diff, diff, diff_y)\n        \n        # try to use the min and max value to get the optimal solution\n        min_diff = float('inf')\n        for start in range(min_val, max_val + 1):\n            end = start + 1\n            current_nums = []\n            for num in nums:\n                if num == -1:\n                    if not current_nums:\n                        current_nums.append(start)\n                    else:\n                        current_nums.append(end)\n                else:\n                    current_nums.append(num)\n            diff = 0\n            for i in range(len(current_nums) - 1):\n                diff = max(diff, abs(current_nums[i] - current_nums[i+1]))\n            min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)\n        return min_diff\n```"

The '*' in `p` can be replaced with any sequence of zero or more characters.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- `1 <= s.length <= 50`\n- `1 <= p.length <= 50`\n- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.\n- `p` contains only lowercase English letters and exactly one '*'.\n- A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.\n\nInput: A string `s` and a pattern string `p`.\nOutput: `True` if `p` can be made a substring of `s`, `False` otherwise.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The '*' in `p` can match any sequence of zero or more characters in `s`, including an empty sequence.\n- The match must be a contiguous substring of `s`.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The '*' in `p` can be replaced with any sequence of zero or more characters, which means we need to consider all possible substrings of `s` that could match `p`.\n- Since `p` contains exactly one '*', we can split `p` into two parts: `p_before` and `p_after`, where `p_before` is the part before '*' and `p_after` is the part after '*'.\n- For `p` to be a substring of `s`, `p_before` must match the start of a substring of `s`, and `p_after` must match the end of that substring.\n- The '*' can match any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence), so we need to check all possible substrings of `s` that start with `p_before` and end with `p_after`.\n- We can iterate over `s` to find a substring that starts with `p_before` and then check if the remaining part of `s` (after removing `p_before`) ends with `p_after`.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- `s = leetcode, p = ee*e` should return `True`.\n- `s = car, p = c*v` should return `False`.\n- `s = luck, p = u*` should return `True`.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Find the '*' in `p` and split `p` into `p_before` and `p_after`.\n2. Iterate over all substrings of `s` to find a match for `p`.\n3. For each substring, check if it starts with `p_before`.\n4. If it does, check if the remaining part of the substring ends with `p_after`.\n5. If a match is found, return `True`.\n6. If no match is found after checking all substrings, return `False`.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases:\n\n- We can optimize the solution by only considering substrings of `s` that are at least as long as `p_before` and `p_after`.\n- We need to handle the case where `p_before` or `p_after` is an empty string.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def hasMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:\n        star_index = p.find('*')\n        p_before = p[:star_index]\n        p_after = p[star_index + 1:]\n        \n        for start in range(len(s)):\n            if s[start:start + len(p_before)] == p_before:\n                remaining_s = s[start + len(p_before):]\n                if remaining_s.endswith(p_after):\n                    return True\n        return False\n```"

The dissatisfaction for each order is calculated as the difference between the shipping day and the order placement day.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* There are N orders, and each order i will be placed on Day T_i.\n* At most K orders can be shipped together.\n* Order i can only be shipped on Day T_i or later.\n* Once a shipment is made, the next shipment cannot be made until X days later.\n* 1 \u2264 K \u2264 N \u2264 100\n* 1 \u2264 X \u2264 10^9\n* 1 \u2264 T_1 \u2264 T_2 \u2264 ... \u2264 T_N \u2264 10^12\n\nInput:\n\n* N: the number of orders\n* K: the maximum number of orders that can be shipped together\n* X: the minimum number of days between shipments\n* T: a list of order placement days\n\nOutput:\n\n* The minimum possible total dissatisfaction accumulated over all orders\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The shipping day for each order must be on or after the order placement day.\n* The dissatisfaction for each order is calculated based on the difference between the shipping day and the order placement day.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The problem can be solved using a greedy approach.\n* The idea is to ship orders as early as possible while satisfying the constraints.\n* The orders can be shipped in a way that minimizes the dissatisfaction.\n* The problem can be broken down into smaller sub-problems by considering the orders that can be shipped together.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The greedy approach is based on the property that the optimal solution can be constructed by making locally optimal choices.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* The algorithm iterates over the orders and tries to ship as many orders as possible on each shipment day.\n* The algorithm keeps track of the current day and the number of orders that have been shipped.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* The algorithm needs to consider the case where an order cannot be shipped on the current day.\n* The algorithm needs to update the current day and the number of orders that have been shipped accordingly.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example in the problem statement illustrates the idea of shipping orders in a way that minimizes the dissatisfaction.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the input values from stdin.\n2. Initialize the current day and the total dissatisfaction.\n3. Iterate over the orders and try to ship as many orders as possible on each shipment day.\n4. For each order, calculate the dissatisfaction and update the current day and the total dissatisfaction.\n5. Keep track of the number of orders that have been shipped and update the current day accordingly.\n6. Handle the case where an order cannot be shipped on the current day.\n7. Output the minimum possible total dissatisfaction accumulated over all orders.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* The algorithm needs to handle the case where the number of orders that can be shipped together is less than the number of orders.\n* The algorithm needs to handle the case where the minimum number of days between shipments is greater than the difference between the shipping day and the order placement day.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef read_input():\n    try:\n        N, K, X = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        T = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n        return N, K, X, T\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error reading input: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return None\n\ndef calculate_dissatisfaction(N, K, X, T):\n    pq = []\n    curr_day = 0\n    total_dissatisfaction = 0\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < N or pq:\n        if not pq and idx < N:\n            curr_day = max(curr_day, T[idx])\n            heapq.heappush(pq, (T[idx], idx))\n            idx += 1\n        else:\n            batch = []\n            for _ in range(min(K, len(pq))):\n                t, i = heapq.heappop(pq)\n                batch.append((t, i))\n\n            ship_day = max(curr_day, batch[0][0])\n            curr_day = ship_day + X\n\n            for t, i in batch:\n                total_dissatisfaction += ship_day - t\n\n            while idx < N and len(pq) < K and T[idx] <= curr_day:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (T[idx], idx))\n                idx += 1\n\n    return total_dissatisfaction\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = read_input()\n    if input_data is None:\n        return\n\n    N, K, X, T = input_data\n    dissatisfaction = calculate_dissatisfaction(N, K, X, T)\n    print(dissatisfaction)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the number of integer triples (i, j, k) in a given string S, consisting of uppercase English letters, that satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. 1 \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 |S|\n2. The length-3 string formed by concatenating S_i, S_j, and S_k in this order is a palindrome.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- S is a string of length between 1 and 2 \u00d7 10^5, inclusive.\n- S consists of uppercase English letters.\n- The input string may contain repeated characters.\n- The palindrome condition must be checked for all possible triples (i, j, k).\n\nInput: A string S consisting of uppercase English letters.\nOutput: The number of integer triples (i, j, k) that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The problem statement does not explicitly mention how to handle the case when the input string is empty, but it is implied that the input string will always have a length between 1 and 2 \u00d7 10^5.\n- The problem requires counting distinct triples (i, j, k), not the number of unique palindromes.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n- A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For a length-3 string to be a palindrome, the first and last characters must be the same.\n- The problem can be solved by iterating over all possible triples (i, j, k) in the string S and checking if the formed string is a palindrome.\n- The palindrome condition can be checked by comparing the characters at positions i, j, and k.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n- The property of palindromes that the first and last characters must be the same.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n- The problem can be solved using a brute-force approach by iterating over all possible triples (i, j, k) and checking the palindrome condition.\n- The algorithm can be optimized by using a single loop to iterate over the string S and checking all possible triples (i, j, k) that can be formed.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n- The need to check all possible triples (i, j, k) in the string S.\n- The importance of handling repeated characters in the input string.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n- The example with the input string \"ABCACC\" and the output 5.\n- The example with the input string \"OOOOOOOO\" and the output 56.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the input string S from stdin.\n2. Initialize a counter to store the number of valid triples (i, j, k).\n3. Iterate over all possible triples (i, j, k) in the string S.\n4. For each triple (i, j, k), form the length-3 string by concatenating S_i, S_j, and S_k.\n5. Check if the formed string is a palindrome by comparing the characters at positions i, j, and k.\n6. If the string is a palindrome, increment the counter.\n7. Write the final count of valid triples (i, j, k) to stdout.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- Handling repeated characters in the input string.\n- Optimizing the algorithm to reduce the time complexity.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        S = input().strip()\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(S)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(S)):\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(S)):\n                    substring = S[i] + S[j] + S[k]\n                    if is_palindrome(substring):\n                        count += 1\n        print(count)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires determining whether there exists a cycle that contains vertex 1 in a simple directed graph with N vertices and M edges. If such a cycle exists, the task is to find the minimum number of edges among such cycles.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 2 \u2264 N \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 M \u2264 min(N(N-1)/2, 2 \u00d7 10^5)\n- 1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 N\n- 1 \u2264 b_i \u2264 N\n- a_i \u2260 b_i\n- (a_i, b_i) \u2260 (a_j, b_j) and (a_i, b_i) \u2260 (b_j, a_j) for i \u2260 j\n- All input values are integers\n\nInput: The number of vertices N, the number of edges M, and M lines of edges (a_i, b_i)\nOutput: The minimum number of edges in a cycle that contains vertex 1, or -1 if no such cycle exists\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The graph is simple and directed\n- The cycle must contain vertex 1\n- The task is to find the minimum number of edges among such cycles\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- A cycle in a directed graph can be detected using depth-first search (DFS) by keeping track of the current path being explored and checking if we ever revisit a node that's already in the current path.\n- To find the minimum number of edges in a cycle that contains vertex 1, we need to adapt our approach to keep track of the path length when a cycle is detected and specifically focus on cycles that include vertex 1.\n- Using an adjacency list representation of the graph allows for efficient exploration of neighbors of a given vertex.\n- A recursive DFS function can be used to explore the graph, keep track of the current path, and detect cycles.\n- When a cycle is detected, we need to check if vertex 1 is in the cycle and update the minimum cycle length if necessary.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n- Sample Input 1: 3 3, 1 2, 2 3, 3 1 (a cycle with 3 edges)\n- Sample Input 2: 3 2, 1 2, 2 3 (no cycle containing vertex 1)\n- Sample Input 3: 6 9, 6 1, 1 5, 2 6, 2 1, 3 6, 4 2, 6 4, 3 5, 5 4 (a cycle with 4 edges)\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input from stdin: the number of vertices N, the number of edges M, and M lines of edges (a_i, b_i).\n2. Construct an adjacency list representation of the graph.\n3. Implement a recursive DFS function that explores the graph, keeps track of the current path, and detects cycles.\n4. When a cycle is detected, check if vertex 1 is in the cycle and update the minimum cycle length if necessary.\n5. Start the DFS from vertex 1 and explore the graph.\n6. If a cycle containing vertex 1 is found, return the minimum number of edges in such a cycle. Otherwise, return -1.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- Use a visited array or a similar mechanism to keep track of visited vertices and their status (whether they are in the current recursion stack or not).\n- Use a recursive DFS function to explore the graph and detect cycles.\n- Update the minimum cycle length when a cycle containing vertex 1 is detected.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N, M = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n        for _ in range(M):\n            a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            graph[a].append(b)\n        \n        min_cycle_length = float('inf')\n        \n        def dfs(node, parent, path):\n            nonlocal min_cycle_length\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor == parent:\n                    continue\n                if neighbor in path:\n                    cycle_path = path[path.index(neighbor):]\n                    if 1 in cycle_path:\n                        cycle_length = len(cycle_path)\n                        min_cycle_length = min(min_cycle_length, cycle_length)\n                else:\n                    dfs(neighbor, node, path + [neighbor])\n        \n        visited = [False] * (N + 1)\n        dfs(1, None, [1])\n        \n        if min_cycle_length == float('inf'):\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print(min_cycle_length)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the K_i-th character from the beginning of a string S after performing a specific operation 10^{100} times. The operation involves changing uppercase letters in S to lowercase, and lowercase letters to uppercase, then concatenating S and the modified string T in this order to form a new S.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The string S consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters, with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive.\n- The number of queries Q and the query indices K_i are integers.\n- 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 2 * 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 K_i \u2264 10^{18}\n\nInput: The string S, the number of queries Q, and the query indices K_i.\nOutput: The characters at the specified indices after the operations.\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n- The operations are performed 10^{100} times, which is an enormous number, implying that the pattern of the string will repeat many times.\n- The string length doubles after each operation.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n- The string S will be concatenated with its modified version T many times, resulting in a repeated pattern.\n- The length of the string after n operations can be expressed as 2^n * len(S).\n- The character at index K_i can be found by determining which operation iteration and position within that iteration it falls into.\n- The pattern of the string repeats every len(S) * 2^n, but this can be simplified by considering the parity of the operation iteration.\n- The index within the operation iteration can be calculated using the binary representation of the operation iteration.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n- The problem can be solved by finding the equivalent index in the original string S or its modified version T.\n- The equivalent index can be found by taking the query index K_i modulo the length of the string after 10^{100} operations.\n- The parity of the operation iteration determines whether the character is from the original string S or its modified version T.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n- The example with S = aB and K_i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 helps illustrate the pattern of the string after multiple operations.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the input string S, the number of queries Q, and the query indices K_i from stdin.\n2. Calculate the length of the string S.\n3. For each query index K_i, calculate its equivalent index in the original string S or its modified version T.\n4. Determine whether the character at the equivalent index is from the original string S or its modified version T based on the parity of the operation iteration.\n5. Use the equivalent index and the parity of the operation iteration to find the character at the specified index.\n6. Write the characters at the specified indices to stdout.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases:\n\n- Use the modulo operator to handle large query indices K_i.\n- Use bitwise operations to calculate the equivalent index and the parity of the operation iteration.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        len_S = len(S)\n        Q = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        K_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n\n        result = []\n\n        for K in K_list:\n            n = 0\n            temp_K = K\n            while temp_K > len_S:\n                temp_K -= len_S\n                len_S *= 2\n                n += 1\n\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                index = temp_K - 1\n                if index >= 0 and index < len(S):\n                    result.append(S[index])\n            else:\n                index = temp_K - 1\n                if index >= 0 and index < len(S):\n                    if S[index].isupper():\n                        result.append(S[index].lower())\n                    else:\n                        result.append(S[index].upper())\n        print(' '.join(result))\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem is to determine the winner of a card game between two players, Takahashi and Aoki. The game starts with Takahashi having N cards, Aoki having M cards, and there being L cards on the table. The players take turns playing a card from their hand onto the table, and if there is a card on the table with a smaller number, they can take that card into their hand. The game ends when one player cannot make a move, and the other player wins.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 1 \u2264 N, M, L\n* N + M + L \u2264 12\n* 1 \u2264 A_i, B_i, C_i \u2264 10^9\n* All input values are integers.\n* The game always ends in a finite number of moves.\n\nInput:\n\n* N, M, L (number of cards in Takahashi's hand, Aoki's hand, and on the table)\n* A_1, ..., A_N (cards in Takahashi's hand)\n* B_1, ..., B_M (cards in Aoki's hand)\n* C_1, ..., C_L (cards on the table)\n\nOutput:\n\n* The winner of the game, either \"Takahashi\" or \"Aoki\".\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The players play optimally.\n* The game state is fully observable.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* The game can be approached using a recursive strategy or dynamic programming.\n* The key to solving the problem is to consider all possible moves for each player and determine the outcome of each move.\n* The game state can be represented by the current hand and table cards for both players.\n* The optimal strategy involves using a minimax algorithm or a similar approach to evaluate the game tree.\n* The game's outcome depends on whether a player can make a move that leads to the other player not being able to make a move.\n* The state of the game can be memoized to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* Sample Input 1: N = 1, M = 1, L = 2, A = [2], B = [4], C = [1, 3]\n* Sample Input 2: N = 4, M = 4, L = 4, A = [98, 98765, 987654, 987654321], B = [987, 9876, 9876543, 98765432], C = [123, 12345, 1234567, 123456789]\n* Sample Input 3: N = 1, M = 1, L = 8, A = [10], B = [10], C = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input from stdin.\n2. Initialize the game state with the given cards.\n3. Use a recursive function or dynamic programming to evaluate the game tree.\n4. Consider all possible moves for each player and determine the outcome of each move.\n5. Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n6. Determine the winner of the game based on the optimal strategy.\n7. Write the winner of the game to stdout.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* Memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n* Handling the base case where a player cannot make a move.\n* Considering all possible moves for each player.\n* Using a minimax algorithm or a similar approach to evaluate the game tree.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef can_move(hand, table):\n    if not hand:\n        return False\n    for card in hand:\n        if any(card > t for t in table):\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef play_game(takahashi_hand, aoki_hand, table):\n    memo = {}\n    def dfs(takahashi_hand, aoki_hand, table, is_takahashi_turn):\n        state = (tuple(sorted(takahashi_hand)), tuple(sorted(aoki_hand)), tuple(sorted(table)), is_takahashi_turn)\n        if state in memo:\n            return memo[state]\n        if is_takahashi_turn:\n            if not can_move(takahashi_hand, table):\n                result = False\n            else:\n                result = False\n                for i, card in enumerate(takahashi_hand):\n                    new_takahashi_hand = takahashi_hand[:i] + takahashi_hand[i+1:]\n                    new_table = table + [card]\n                    takahashi_can_take = [t for t in new_table if t < card]\n                    if takahashi_can_take:\n                        for take_card in takahashi_can_take:\n                            new_table.remove(take_card)\n                            new_takahashi_hand.append(take_card)\n                            temp_result = dfs(tuple(sorted(new_takahashi_hand)), tuple(sorted(aoki_hand)), tuple(sorted(new_table)), False)\n                            new_takahashi_hand.remove(take_card)\n                            new_table.append(take_card)\n                            if not temp_result:\n                                result = True\n                                break\n                    else:\n                        temp_result = dfs(tuple(sorted(new_takahashi_hand)), tuple(sorted(aoki_hand)), tuple(sorted(new_table)), False)\n                        if not temp_result:\n                            result = True\n                            break\n                if not result:\n                    memo[state] = False\n                    return False\n        else:\n            if not can_move(aoki_hand, table):\n                result = True\n            else:\n                result = True\n                for i, card in enumerate(aoki_hand):\n                    new_aoki_hand = aoki_hand[:i] + aoki_hand[i+1:]\n                    new_table = table + [card]\n                    aoki_can_take = [t for t in new_table if t < card]\n                    if aoki_can_take:\n                        for take_card in aoki_can_take:\n                            new_table.remove(take_card)\n                            new_aoki_hand.append(take_card)\n                            temp_result = dfs(tuple(sorted(takahashi_hand)), tuple(sorted(new_aoki_hand)), tuple(sorted(new_table)), True)\n                            new_aoki_hand.remove(take_card)\n                            new_table.append(take_card)\n                            if temp_result:\n                                result = False\n                                break\n                    else:\n                        temp_result = dfs(tuple(sorted(takahashi_hand)), tuple(sorted(new_aoki_hand)), tuple(sorted(new_table)), True)\n                        if temp_result:\n                            result = False\n                            break\n                if not result:\n                    memo[state] = True\n                    return True\n        memo[state] = result\n        return result\n    return dfs(tuple(takahashi_hand), tuple(aoki_hand), tuple(table), True)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N, M, L = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        A = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n        B = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n        C = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n\n        if play_game(A, B, C):\n            print(\"Takahashi\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Aoki\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

        "question_content": "The definition of an 11/22 string in this problem is the same as in Problems A and C.\n\nA string T is called an 11/22 string when it satisfies all of the following conditions:\n\n- |T| is odd. Here, |T| denotes the length of T.\n- The 1-st through (\\frac{|T|+1}{2} - 1)-th characters are all 1.\n- The (\\frac{|T|+1}{2})-th character is /.\n- The (\\frac{|T|+1}{2} + 1)-th through |T|-th characters are all 2.\n\nFor example, 11/22, 111/222, and / are 11/22 strings, but 1122, 1/22, 11/2222, 22/11, and //2/2/211 are not.\nGiven a string S of length N consisting of 1, 2, and /, process Q queries.\nEach query provides two integers L and R. Let T be the (contiguous) substring of S from the L-th through R-th character. Find the maximum length of a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) of T that is an 11/22 string. If no such subsequence exists, print 0.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format. Here, \\mathrm{query}_i denotes the i-th query.\nN Q\nS\n\\mathrm{query}_1\n\\mathrm{query}_2\n\\vdots\n\\mathrm{query}_Q\n\nEach query is given in the following format:\nL R\n\nOutput\n\nPrint Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n- 1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5\n- S is a string of length N consisting of 1, 2, and /.\n- 1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N\n- N, Q, L, and R are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n12 5\n111/212/1122\n1 7\n9 12\n3 6\n4 10\n1 12\n\nSample Output 1\n\n5\n0\n3\n1\n7\n\nFor the first query, the substring from the 1-st to 7-th character of S is 111/212. This string contains 11/22 as a subsequence, which is the longest subsequence that is an 11/22 string. Therefore, the answer is 5.\nFor the second query, the substring from the 9-th to 12-th character of S is 1122. This string does not contain any subsequence that is an 11/22 string, so the answer is 0.",

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the maximum length of a subsequence of a given substring that is an 11/22 string. An 11/22 string is a string with an odd length, where the first half of the string (rounded down) consists of all 1s, the middle character is a /, and the second half consists of all 2s.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The input string S consists of 1, 2, and /.\n* The length of S is between 1 and 10^5.\n* The number of queries Q is between 1 and 10^5.\n* For each query, the left and right indices L and R are between 1 and the length of S.\n* The substring from L to R may not contain a /.\n\nInput: A string S and Q queries, each with two integers L and R.\nOutput: The maximum length of a subsequence of the substring from L to R that is an 11/22 string.\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n* The subsequence does not need to be contiguous.\n* The length of the 11/22 string must be odd.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* To find the maximum length of an 11/22 string subsequence, we need to consider all possible lengths of 11/22 strings that can be formed from the given substring.\n* We can use prefix sums to efficiently calculate the number of 1s and 2s in any substring.\n* The maximum length of an 11/22 string subsequence can be found by iterating over possible lengths of 11/22 strings and checking if we can form such a string from the characters in the substring.\n* We need to find the maximum number of 1s before the /, the maximum number of 2s after the /, and ensure there is at least one /.\n* The length of the 11/22 string must be odd, so we can iterate over odd lengths.\n\nCritical examples:\n\n* The example with S = 111/212/1122 and query (1, 7) shows that the maximum length of an 11/22 string subsequence can be 5.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input string S and the number of queries Q.\n2. For each query, read the left and right indices L and R.\n3. Calculate the prefix sums of 1s and 2s in the string S.\n4. Iterate over possible lengths of 11/22 strings (odd lengths from 1 to R - L + 1).\n5. For each length, calculate the maximum number of 1s before the /, the maximum number of 2s after the /, and ensure there is at least one /.\n6. Use binary search to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s in the substring.\n7. Update the maximum length of the 11/22 string subsequence.\n8. Print the maximum length of the 11/22 string subsequence for each query.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N, Q = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n        S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        \n        ones = [0] * (N + 1)\n        twos = [0] * (N + 1)\n        slashes = [0] * (N + 1)\n        \n        for i in range(N):\n            ones[i + 1] = ones[i]\n            twos[i + 1] = twos[i]\n            slashes[i + 1] = slashes[i]\n            if S[i] == '1':\n                ones[i + 1] += 1\n            elif S[i] == '2':\n                twos[i + 1] += 1\n            elif S[i] == '/':\n                slashes[i + 1] += 1\n        \n        for _ in range(Q):\n            L, R = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            L -= 1\n            R -= 1\n            \n            max_len = 0\n            for length in range(1, R - L + 2, 2):\n                if (L + length) > R:\n                    break\n                mid = (L + R + length + 1) // 2 - 1\n                if mid < L or mid > R:\n                    continue\n                one_count = ones[mid + 1] - ones[L]\n                two_count = twos[R + 1] - twos[mid + 1]\n                slash_count = slashes[mid + 1] - slashes[L]\n                if one_count > 0 and two_count > 0 and slash_count > 0 and length == one_count + 1 + two_count:\n                    max_len = max(max_len, length)\n            print(max_len)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

The goal is to find the final positions of the bars at time t = 10^100.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 1 \u2264 H, W \u2264 2 x 10^5\n* 1 \u2264 N \u2264 2 x 10^5\n* 1 \u2264 R_i \u2264 H\n* 1 \u2264 C_i \u2264 W\n* 1 \u2264 L_i \u2264 W - C_i + 1\n* In the initial state, there is no cell occupied by two different bars.\n* All input values are integers.\n\nInput: H, W, N, and the initial positions of the bars (R_i, C_i, L_i) for i = 1 to N.\nOutput: The final positions of the bars (R'_i) at time t = 10^100.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The movement of the bars occurs at every time t = 0.5 + n for some non-negative integer n.\n* A bar moves down by one cell if it is not on the bottom row and none of the cells directly below the cells occupied by the bar is occupied by any bar.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n* The problem can be solved by simulating the movement of the bars over time.\n* The key to the solution is to keep track of the occupied cells and update the positions of the bars accordingly.\n* The movement of the bars can be simulated by iterating over the bars and checking if they can move down.\n* A bar can move down if it is not on the bottom row and none of the cells directly below the cells occupied by the bar is occupied by any bar.\n* The occupied cells can be represented using a set or a similar data structure for efficient lookups.\n* The simulation can be stopped when no more bars can move down.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The sample input 1: H = 4, W = 4, N = 4, and bars are (1, 2, 3), (3, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2), (2, 4, 1).\n* The sample input 2: H = 382, W = 382, N = 3, and bars are (3, 3, 3), (8, 8, 8), (2, 2, 2).\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input from stdin: H, W, N, and the initial positions of the bars (R_i, C_i, L_i) for i = 1 to N.\n2. Initialize a data structure to represent the occupied cells.\n3. Initialize a list to store the current positions of the bars.\n4. Simulate the movement of the bars over time:\n\t* Iterate over the bars and check if they can move down.\n\t* If a bar can move down, update its position and the occupied cells.\n5. Repeat step 4 until no more bars can move down.\n6.

Return the minimum number of vertices that must be deleted to transform T into a Snowflake Tree.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- Optimizing the DFS traversal to reduce the time complexity.\n- Handling the case where the given tree T is already a Snowflake Tree.\n- Handling the case where the minimum number of deletions is 0.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]\n        for _ in range(N - 1):\n            u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            u -= 1\n            v -= 1\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        def dfs(node, parent):\n            children = []\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor != parent:\n                    children.append(neighbor)\n            return children\n\n        def is_snowflake_tree(node, x, y, graph):\n            children = dfs(node, -1)\n            if len(children) != x:\n                return False, 0\n            valid_children = 0\n            for child in children:\n                grandchildren = dfs(child, node)\n                if len(grandchildren) == y:\n                    valid_children += 1\n                else:\n                    return False, 0\n            if valid_children == x:\n                return True, 0\n            else:\n                return False, 0\n\n        min_deletions = N - 1\n        for root in range(N):\n            for x in range(1, N):\n                for y in range(1, N):\n                    children = dfs(root, -1)\n                    if len(children) >= x:\n                        temp_graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]\n                        for u in range(N):\n                            for v in graph[u]:\n                                temp_graph[u].append(v)\n                        deletions = 0\n                        valid_snowflake = True\n                        selected_children = children[:x]\n                        for i in range(x):\n                            child = selected_children[i]\n                            grandchildren = dfs(child, root)\n                            if len(grandchildren) > y:\n                                valid_snowflake = False\n                                break\n                            elif len(grandchildren) < y:\n                                deletions += y - len(grandchildren)\n                        if len(children) > x:\n                            deletions += len(children) - x\n                        if valid_snowflake:\n                            min_deletions = min(min_deletions, deletions)\n        print(min_deletions)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

            "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the maximum height at coordinate 0 from which it is not possible to see all buildings. The buildings are represented by their coordinates and heights on a number line. A building is considered visible from a point P with coordinate x and height h if there exists a point Q on the building such that the line segment PQ does not intersect with any other building.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5, where N is the number of buildings\n- 1 \u2264 X_1 < ... < X_N \u2264 10^9, where X_i is the coordinate of building i\n- 1 \u2264 H_i \u2264 10^9, where H_i is the height of building i\n- All input values are integers\n- If it is possible to see all buildings at height 0 from coordinate 0, report -1 instead\n- The answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-9} from the true answer\n\nInput: The number of buildings N, followed by N pairs of coordinates and heights (X_i, H_i)\nOutput: The maximum height at coordinate 0 from which it is not possible to see all buildings\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n- The size of the buildings in directions other than height is negligible\n- The line segment PQ should not intersect with any other building\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- To determine if all buildings can be seen from a given height at coordinate 0, we need to check if there exists a line from (0, h) that can touch each building without intersecting any other building\n- The equation of the line from (0, h) to (x, 0) is y = -h/x * x + h, which simplifies to y = -h/x * x + h\n- For a building at (X_i, H_i) to be visible, there must be a point (X_i, y) on the building such that the line from (0, h) to (X_i, y) does not intersect any other building\n- The slope of the line from (0, h) to (X_i, H_i) is (H_i - h) / X_i\n- We need to find the maximum height h such that there exists a building that cannot be seen from (0, h)\n- A building is not visible from height h at coordinate 0 if the line from (0, h) to any point on the building intersects with another building\n- We can use a binary search approach to find the maximum height\n\nCritical examples and test cases:\n\n- Sample Input 1: 3 buildings at (3, 2), (5, 4), (7, 5)\n- Sample Input 2: 2 buildings at (1, 1), (2, 100)\n- Sample Input 3: 3 buildings at (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Read the input from stdin and store the coordinates and heights of the buildings\n2. Check if all buildings can be seen from height 0 at coordinate 0\n3. If yes, report -1\n4. Otherwise, use a binary search approach to find the maximum height h\n5. For each mid-height in the binary search, check if all buildings can be seen from that height\n6. If yes, update the lower bound of the search range\n7. If no, update the upper bound of the search range\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until the search range is small enough\n9. Report the maximum height h\n\nImportant optimizations and special cases:\n\n- Use a binary search approach to reduce the number of iterations\n- Check if all buildings can be seen from height 0 at coordinate 0 before starting the binary search\n- Handle the case where the answer is -1 separately\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef can_see_all_buildings(buildings, h):\n    slopes = []\n    for x, H in buildings:\n        if x == 0:\n            if H > h:\n                return False\n            else:\n                continue\n        slope = (H - h) / x\n        slopes.append(slope)\n    slopes.sort()\n    for i in range(len(slopes) - 1):\n        if slopes[i] > slopes[i + 1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        buildings = []\n        for _ in range(N):\n            X, H = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            buildings.append((X, H))\n        \n        def visible_from_zero(h):\n            for x, H in buildings:\n                if x == 0:\n                    if H > h:\n                        return False\n                else:\n                    slope = (H - h) / x\n                    blocked = False\n                    for x_other, H_other in buildings:\n                        if x_other == x:\n                            continue\n                        if x_other < x:\n                            slope_other = (H_other - h) / x_other\n                            if slope_other >= slope:\n                                blocked = True\n                                break\n                        else:\n                            slope_other = (H_other - h) / x_other\n                            if slope_other <= slope:\n                                blocked = True\n                                break\n                    if blocked:\n                        return False\n            return True\n        \n        if visible_from_zero(0):\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            left, right = 0, 10**9\n            while right - left > 10**-9:\n                mid = (left + right) / 2.0\n                if visible_from_zero(mid):\n                    left = mid\n                else:\n                    right = mid\n            print(right)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

The operation involves choosing a white point and coloring it black such that the coloring is symmetric with respect to the line connecting the operator and the center of the circle.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The circle has N equally spaced points numbered 0 to N-1.\n* Alice is at point 0 and Bob is at point K.\n* The points are initially white.\n* The players alternate turns.\n* A player can only color a white point black if it is symmetric with respect to the line connecting the player and the center of the circle.\n* The game ends when a player cannot perform an operation satisfying the symmetry condition.\n* The goal is to determine whether all points can be colored black.\n\nInput: Two integers N and K, representing the number of points on the circle and Bob's position, respectively.\n\nOutput: A string \"Yes\" if all points can be colored black, and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nSubtle requirements and implicit constraints:\n\n* The symmetry condition implies that if a point is colored black, its reflection across the line connecting the player and the center of the circle must also be colored black.\n* The players cooperate to maximize the total number of points colored black.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The symmetry condition can be represented using modular arithmetic, specifically with the equation x + x' \u2261 2 * player_pos (mod N).\n* The greatest common divisor (GCD) of N and K plays a critical role in determining whether all points can be colored black.\n* If the GCD of N and K is 1, it means that K and N are coprime, and the points can be colored black in a way that covers all points.\n* If the GCD of N and K is greater than 1, it indicates that there are certain points that cannot be colored black due to the symmetry constraint.\n* The GCD of N and K can be used to determine whether all points can be colored black.\n\nPatterns and properties used:\n\n* Modular arithmetic to represent the symmetry condition.\n* Properties of the GCD to determine the reachability of all points.\n\nCritical examples and test cases:\n\n* The example with N = 6 and K = 2, where the GCD of 6 and 2 is 2, and all points can be colored black.\n* The example with N = 6 and K = 3, where the GCD of 6 and 3 is 3, and not all points can be colored black.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Read the input values N and K.\n2. Calculate the GCD of N and K.\n3. If the GCD is 1, output \"Yes\", indicating that all points can be colored black.\n4. Otherwise, output \"No\", indicating that not all points can be colored black.\n\nCritical details:\n\n* Use the GCD to determine whether all points can be colored black.\n* Handle the cases where the GCD is 1 and greater than 1 separately.\n\nOptimizations and special cases:\n\n* Use the built-in GCD function in Python to calculate the GCD of N and K efficiently.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())\n            if math.gcd(N, K) == 1:\n                print(\"Yes\")\n            else:\n                print(\"No\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

The operation involves choosing an integer i such that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N-3, finding the midpoint M between the positions of the i-th and (i+3)-rd pieces, and then moving the (i+1)-th and (i+2)-th pieces to positions symmetric to M.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* 4 \u2264 N \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5\n* 0 \u2264 X_1 < X_2 < ... < X_N \u2264 10^12\n* All input values are integers.\n* The pieces always occupy distinct coordinates after any number of operations.\n\nInput: The number of pieces N and their initial coordinates X_1, X_2, ..., X_N.\nOutput: The minimum possible sum of the coordinates of the N pieces after repeating the operations.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The operation can be repeated any number of times, possibly zero.\n* The goal is to minimize the sum of the coordinates of the N pieces.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The operation does not change the sum of the coordinates of the pieces involved in the operation if we consider the change in the sum: \u0394 = (M + (M - x2)) + (M - (x3 - M)) - x2 - x3 = 2M - x2 - x3.\n* The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to explore all possible sequences of operations and their resulting sums.\n* The operation involves moving pieces to be symmetric around the midpoint of the i-th and (i+3)-rd pieces, which can potentially decrease the sum of coordinates if it moves pieces to smaller values.\n* The pieces always occupy distinct coordinates after any number of operations.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The operation's effect on the sum of coordinates.\n* The dynamic programming approach to explore all possible sequences of operations.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* The sample input 1 with N = 4 and X = [1, 5, 7, 10] and the sample output 21.\n* The sample input 2 with N = 6 and X = [0, 1, 6, 10, 14, 16] and the sample output 41.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1.

The absorbed slime disappears, and the current slime's size increases by the size of the absorbed slime.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* There are N slimes lined up in a row from left to right.\n* Each slime has a size A_i.\n* The action can be performed any number of times.\n* The absorbed slime disappears, and the gap is immediately closed.\n* The slimes that were adjacent to the disappearing slime become adjacent.\n* 2 \u2264 N \u2264 5 \u00d7 10^5\n* 1 \u2264 A_i \u2264 10^9\n* All input values are integers.\n\nInput: The number of slimes N and the sizes of the slimes A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.\nOutput: The maximum size that each slime can have after performing the action any number of times.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The problem requires finding the maximum size for each slime, not just the maximum size overall.\n* The action can only be performed on adjacent slimes.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The problem can be solved using a stack-based approach.\n* The stack can be used to keep track of the slimes and their sizes.\n* The maximum size of each slime can be calculated by iterating through the slimes and using the stack to keep track of the slimes that can be absorbed.\n* The problem requires considering the slimes to the left and right of each slime separately.\n* The maximum size of each slime is the maximum size it can have after absorbing all the smaller slimes to its left and right.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The problem uses the concept of a stack to keep track of the slimes and their sizes.\n* The problem uses the property that the maximum size of each slime can be calculated by considering the slimes to its left and right separately.\n\nKey algorithmic insights:\n\n* The algorithm uses a stack-based approach to keep track of the slimes and their sizes.\n* The algorithm iterates through the slimes and uses the stack to calculate the maximum size of each slime.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n* The problem requires considering the slimes to the left and right of each slime separately.\n* The maximum size of each slime is the maximum size it can have after absorbing all the smaller slimes to its left and right.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n\n* The example in the problem statement illustrates the concept of absorbing smaller slimes to increase the size of the current slime.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Read the input from stdin.\n2. Initialize an empty stack.\n3. Iterate through the slimes from left to right.\n4. For each slime, calculate the maximum size it can have by considering the slimes to its left and right separately.\n5. Use the stack to keep track of the slimes that can be absorbed.\n6. Calculate the maximum size of each slime by popping the stack and adding the sizes of the absorbed slimes.\n7. Store the maximum size of each slime in an array.\n8. Iterate through the slimes from right to left and calculate the maximum size of each slime by considering the slimes to its right.\n9. Update the maximum size of each slime in the array.\n10. Write the maximum size of each slime to stdout.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n* The algorithm uses a stack-based approach to keep track of the slimes and their sizes, which reduces the time complexity of the algorithm.\n* The algorithm iterates through the slimes from left to right and right to left to calculate the maximum size of each slime, which ensures that all possible absorptions are considered.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_slime_size(N, A):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the maximum size for each slime.\n\n    Args:\n    N (int): The number of slimes.\n    A (list): The sizes of the slimes.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: The maximum sizes for each slime.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the result array\n    result = [0] * N\n\n    # Stack-based approach to find the maximum size for each slime\n    stack = []\n    for i in range(N):\n        while stack and A[stack[-1]] < A[i]:\n            result[stack.pop()] = A[i]\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    # Fill the result array for the remaining slimes in the stack\n    while stack:\n        idx = stack.pop()\n        result[idx] = A[idx]\n\n    # Consider the left side\n    for i in range(N):\n        tmp = A[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and A[j] < tmp:\n            tmp += A[j]\n            j -= 1\n        result[i] = max(result[i], tmp)\n\n    # Consider the right side\n    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):\n        tmp = A[i]\n        j = i + 1\n        while j < N and A[j] < tmp:\n            tmp += A[j]\n            j += 1\n        result[i] = max(result[i], tmp)\n\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Read input from stdin\n        N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n        A = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n\n        # Calculate the maximum sizes\n        result = max_slime_size(N, A)\n\n        # Write output to stdout\n        print(*result)\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
